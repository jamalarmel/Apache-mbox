Hi Andy, Usually new Apache incubator has dev@ list without users@ to make sure all the effort and discussion focused in one mailing list. But Spark, and like several other podlings, already have enough users that warrant creation of users@ list. I am +1 to create that list if all think that its the way to go. - Henry On Tue, Jun 25, 2013 at 10:18 AM, Andy Konwinski  This is great. Hi Matei, Some podlings have JIRA messages delivered to dev@ list. Maybe we could have issues@ later. I think for now we could just use dev@ list as reservoir for JIRA notifications. - Henry On Tue, Jun 25, 2013 at 10:56 AM, Matei Zaharia  Yeah, similarly to the users list, we asked for a "commits" one on the +1 from me. If no objection and no one does it before me I will update the report tomorrow. - Henry On Sat, Jul 6, 2013 at 1:48 PM, Matei Zaharia  Hey Chris, unfortunately I don't have permission to edit the wiki page (on Hi All, Since the git repo already created for Apche Spark should all patch requests go to https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-spark.git with ASF Jira or pull request to github still accepted? - Henry Ah cool, no worries Matei. I was just curious about it since ASF INFRA had closed the issue Chris filed. - Henry On Sun, Jul 14, 2013 at 10:08 AM, Matei Zaharia  Hi Henry, The git repo is up and I was able to pull and commit locally.

Some CI tools like hudson can support multi Maven profiles via different jobs so we could deliver different release artifacts for different Maven profiles. I believe it should be fine to have Spark-hadoop1 and Spark-haddop2 release modules. Just curious how actually SBT avoid/resolve this problem? To support for different hadoop versions we need to change in the SparkBuild.scala to make it work. And as far as maintaining just one build system I am +1 for it. I prefer to use Maven bc it has better dependency management than SBT.

LGTM. I have signed off the report. Thanks Matei - Henry On Wed, Aug 7, 2013 at 2:52 PM, Matei Zaharia  Ah, good idea. I've added that in. Hi Guys, I am thinking about keeping the users list with Google groups and mirror the messages to user@spark.i.a.o. This way users can communicate via Google groups forum style rather than Apache mailing list, Most developers contributing to Spark have to use Apache way to communicate but as for users, we could always let them communicate via Google groups but mirror the emails (or subscribe user@spark.i.a.o as member of Spark users Google group). Thoughts? - Henry We'll let the other mentors chime in and give their thoughts. I have been looking at the Apache policy about public listing [1] and could not find anything about cross posting. Yeah, like Andy proposed before I am thinking about just subscribing the user@spark.i.a.o to Google groups and allow Google groups email to send email to the mailing list. Not sure what permission Chris set when creating the list but I did allow the JIRA emails to sent to other Apache list without actually subscribe to it. - Henry [1] http://www.apache.org/foundation/public-archives.html On Tue, Aug 20, 2013 at 11:37 AM, Matei Zaharia  Hi Henry, Oh, dont get me wrong, there will still be user list but we hopefully could mirror the content from Google groups mailing list. As for dev list, it is kind of similar situation but dev list is probably ok to use mailing list because most people in the list would be more flexible to not use UI for managing messages. The reason is because as part of the Apache way, the dev list is the main channel of communication for discussions and decision making for the community so I would prefer contributors to use the list directly. - Henry On Tue, Aug 20, 2013 at 1:21 PM, Andy Konwinski  Also, if we do it for the users group/list, is there any reason not to do Hi Jey, just want to clarify that the changes happen to master branch in the github and not the Apache git repository?

So looks like we could try/ experiment it with user@spark.i.a.o list with Google group as client to send emails/messages to Apache Spark's user list. I know we can allow external email address to send emails to user@ list but I dont think we could manually add Spark's user@ email address as member of Spark's Google group, or do we?

I only see source artifacts in Patrick's p.a.o URL. I assume the pre-built ones will also be published with hash and signed? 2. For every ASF release, we need designated release engineer (RE) that will drive the release process including determining bugs to be included, make sure all files have the right ASF header (running maven RAT plugin check), create release branch, update version for next development, create release artifacts and sign them correctly. I assume this would be Matei or Patrick? 3. The proposed source artifacts 0.8.0-RC2's signature looks good and hash looks good. However it was generated against github mesos:spark repo. Reminder that when we send proposal for release to general@incubator.a.o we need to generate RC builds using ASF git repo with the right tagged branch. 4. I ran RAT check for the source artifact and found a lot of source do not have ASF license header. For example some in repl directory has this: /* NSC -- new Scala compiler * Copyright 2005-2011 LAMP/EPFL * @author Paul Phillips */ Not sure if we need to ASF header to it since we are technically put in under apache package. Scala source files under mllib are missing ASF headers. 5. Add public key of RE to http://people.apache.org/keys/group/spark.asc (@Chris do we still need to create KEYS file in the Spark git repo?) Once these are completed then the RE will ask dev@ list to verify the proposed RC build/artifacts through VOTE thread.

The release manager must inform general@incubator that the vote has passed on the podling's development list, and should indicate any IPMC votes gained during that process. A new vote on the release candidate artifacts must now be held on general@incubator to seek majority consensus from the IPMC. Previous IPMC votes issued on the project's development list count towards that goal.

There are already work pending for new replay debugging (I could not find the PR links for it) so I With version control we could always reinstate the old doc if needed, but as of today the doc is no longer reflect the current state of Spark's RDD. If no objection I could send PR to remove the md file in master. Thoughts? - Henry Cool, thanks Ankur, sounds good.

For patches that are not critical, waiting for a while to let some time for additional committers to review would be the best way to go. Another thing is that all contributors need to be patience once their patches have been submitted and pending reviewed. This is part of being in open community. Hope this helps. - Henry [1] http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#LazyConsensus On Mon, Jul 21, 2014 at 1:59 PM, Patrick Wendell  wrote: NOTICE and LICENSE files look good Hashes and sigs look good No executable in the source distribution Compile source and run standalone +1 - Henry On Fri, Jul 25, 2014 at 4:08 PM, Tathagata Das wrote: Yup, I am seeing this in some other Apache projects as well and usually if being asked to add more information more reporter gladly comply as requested.
