Dear podling,

This email was sent by an automated system on behalf of the Apache Incubator PMC.
It is an initial reminder to give you plenty of time to prepare your quarterly
board report.

The board meeting is scheduled for Wed, 21 August 2013, 10:30:00:00 PST. The report 
for your podling will form a part of the Incubator PMC report. The Incubator PMC 
requires your report to be submitted 2 weeks before the board meeting, to allow 
sufficient time for review and submission (Wed, Aug 7th).

Please submit your report with sufficient time to allow the incubator PMC, and 
subsequently board members to review and digest. Again, the very latest you 
should submit your report is 2 weeks prior to the board meeting.

Thanks,

The Apache Incubator PMC

Submitting your Report
----------------------

Your report should contain the following:

 * Your project name
 * A brief description of your project, which assumes no knowledge of the project
   or necessarily of its field
 * A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards 
   graduation.
 * Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of
 * How has the community developed since the last report
 * How has the project developed since the last report.
 
This should be appended to the Incubator Wiki page at:

  http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/August2013

Note: This manually populated. You may need to wait a little before this page is
      created from a template.

Mentors
-------
Mentors should review reports for their project(s) and sign them off on the 
Incubator wiki page. Signing off reports shows that you are following the 
project - projects that are not signed may raise alarms for the Incubator PMC.

Incubator PMC

Hey All,

I'm working on SPARK-800 [1]. The goal is to document a best practice or
recommended way of bundling and running Spark jobs. We have a quickstart
guide for writing a standlone job, but it doesn't cover how to deal with
packaging up your dependencies and setting the correct environment
variables required to submit a full job to a cluster. This can be a
confusing process for beginners - it would be good to extend the guide to
cover this.

First though I wanted to sample this list and see how people tend to run
Spark jobs inside their org's. Knowing any of the following would be
helpful:

- Do you create an uber jar with all of your job (and Spark)'s recursive
dependencies?
- Do you try to use sbt run or maven exec with some way to pass the correct
environment variables?
- Do people use a modified version of spark's own `run` script?
- Do you have some other way of submitting jobs?

Any notes would be helpful in compiling this!

Guys, just wanted to close the loop on this.

I have committed the packaging support for Spark (BIGTOP-715) into Bigtop
master. The packaging is built on top of the Maven assembly and provides
standard Linux services to control master and worker daemons.

Shark is next in the pipeline ;)

Now that Spark has been integrated into Bigtop:
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-715
it may make sense to tackle some of those issues from a
distribution perspective. Bigtop has a luxury of defining an
entire distribution (you always know what versions of Hadoop
and its ecosystem projects your're dealing with). It also
provides helper functionality for a lot of common things (like
finding JAVA_HOME, plugging into the underlying
OS capabilities, etc.).

I guess all I'm saying is that you guys should consider Bigtop
as an integration platform for making Spark easier to use.

Feel free to fork off this thread to dev@bigtop (CCed) if you
think this is an idea worth exploring.

Thanks,
Roman.

Thanks Matei

One question, do we want to mention about the plan to migrate website
content for http://spark.incubator.apache.org ?

Dear podling,

This email was sent by an automated system on behalf of the Apache Incubator PMC.
It is an initial reminder to give you plenty of time to prepare your quarterly
board report.

The board meeting is scheduled for Wed, 21 August 2013, 10:30:00:00 PST. The report 
for your podling will form a part of the Incubator PMC report. The Incubator PMC 
requires your report to be submitted 2 weeks before the board meeting, to allow 
sufficient time for review and submission (Wed, Aug 7th).

Please submit your report with sufficient time to allow the incubator PMC, and 
subsequently board members to review and digest. Again, the very latest you 
should submit your report is 2 weeks prior to the board meeting.

Thanks,

The Apache Incubator PMC

Submitting your Report
----------------------

Your report should contain the following:

 * Your project name
 * A brief description of your project, which assumes no knowledge of the project
   or necessarily of its field
 * A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards 
   graduation.
 * Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of
 * How has the community developed since the last report
 * How has the project developed since the last report.
 
This should be appended to the Incubator Wiki page at:

  http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/August2013

Note: This manually populated. You may need to wait a little before this page is
      created from a template.

Mentors
-------
Mentors should review reports for their project(s) and sign them off on the 
Incubator wiki page. Signing off reports shows that you are following the 
project - projects that are not signed may raise alarms for the Incubator PMC.

I've noticed that Spark's Java API is inconsistent in how it represents
optional values. Some methods use scala.Option instances, while others use
Guava's Optional:

scala.Option is used in by methods like JavaSparkContext.getSparkHome(),
and the *outerJoin methods return a JavaPairRDD[K, (V, Option[W])].

Guava Optional is used in methods like Java*RDD.getCheckpointFile() and
JavaPairDStream.updateStateByKey() function arguments.

I'd like to remove this inconsistency and settle on a single class for
representing optional values in the Java API.

Both APIs are similar, but the Guava API seems nicer for Java users.  For
example, scala.Option.getOrElse(default) accepts a function, which isn't
really usable from Java.

http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option
http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Optional.html

If we switch to exclusively using Guava Optional, we'd have to convert join
results before turning them into JavaRDDs so that we have JavaPairRDD[K,
(V, Optional[W])].  I don't anticipate this being a large performance issue.

This would be a backwards-incompatible API change and 0.8 seems like the
easiest time to make it.  I'd appreciate any thoughts on whether I should
use Guava Optional everywhere.

Thanks,
Josh

For the streaming stuff, I'm fairly sure I used Guava (or I at least *want*
it to be Guava) so I'm personally in full support of Guava for this.

Hey Patrick,

A while back I posted an SBT recipe allowing users to build Scala job
assemblies that excluded Spark and its deps, which is what most people want
I believe.  This allows you to include your own libraries and exclude
Spark's for the smallest possible one.

We don't use Spark's run script, instead we have SBT configured so that you
can simply type "run" to run jobs.   I believe this gives maximum developer
velocity.   We also have "sbt console" hooked up so that you can run spark
shell from it (no need for ./spark-shell script).

And, as you know, we are going to contribute back a job server.   We
believe that for most organizations this will provide the easiest way for
submitting and managing jobs -- IT/OPS sets up Spark as HTTP service (using
job server), and users/developers can submit jobs to a managed service.
We even have a giter8 template to make creating jobs for job server super
simple.  The template has support for local run, spark shell, assembly, and
testing.

So anyways, I believe we'll have a lot to contribute to your guide -- both
now and especially once the job server is contributed....  feel free to
touch base offline.

-Evan

Hi folks,

In order to make the 0.8 release soon, I've created a new branch for it, =
on which we'll merge only bug fixes and a few of the new deployment =
features we still want there (e.g. updated EC2 scripts and some work to =
build one artifact that works with all Hadoop versions). If you continue =
sending pull requests against master, we will cherry-pick the ones with =
bug fixes into branch-0.8. Let me know if there are any other things you =
believe should be in 0.8 as well.

Matei=

Hi Matei,

  Not sure if it is already planned, but the write related Connection  race
condition Patrick reported/fixed might need to go to 0.8 also ...

I was thinking of making a backwards-incompatible API change in the Java
API, described at
https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-spark-dev/201308.mbox/%3CCAOEPXP5iWWTSEhJGq5eafpPY1Dxp8ZTAfuhX9w-2%2BaQ3hApbfA%40mail.gmail.com%3E

If nobody objects, I'll implement that change and submit a pull request to
add it to 0.8.  I'm interested in doing this now because we won't break
APIs in 0.8.1+, so it would have to wait until 0.9 if we don't do it now.

I have several planned additions to the Java APIs to add the features
missing from the Scala APIs, but those changes shouldn't introduce any
incompatibilities and can be added in a minor release.

I think a change to Optional is good, so let's do that.

@Evan -- documentation should definitely be added; feel free to send a =
PR adding a page on this to the docs. I also want to take a look at the =
binary distribution stuff once we've figured out the SBT build a little =
bit better.

Hi,

Can someone give details about the future work in ML algorithms (Inside
mllib folder).
Currently there are some basic algorithms implemented. Is there any roadmap
regarding what ML algorithms are required?

Quite interesting, and timely given current thinking around MLlib and MLI

http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/154357/1/paper.pdf

I do really like the way they have approached their API - and so far MLlib
seems to be following a (roughly) similar approach.

Interesting in particular they obviously go for mutable models instead of
the Estimator / Predictor interface MLlib currently has. Not sure which of
these is "best" really, they each have their pros & cons.

Hello everyone,

In ISPRAS (http://ispras.ru) we are working on several problems of 
social network analysis. In our work we are using Bagel implementation 
in Spark.

As one of ways to improve graph analysis performance we implement a 
graph partitioning algorithm based on balanced label propagation (BLP) 
algorithm developed in Facebook 
(http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2433461). One problem is that it 
can't be directly integrated to Bagel since it does not know anything 
about graph edges. As a result interface for passing graph to the 
partitioner is different from interface for passing graph to Bagel. 
Because of this using partitioner requires more code modifications that 
it could.

So we thought about implementing another interface for processing graphs 
that would be aware of edges. Another reason for a different interface 
is that it may be very similar to GraphX so that switching between 
edge-partitioning and vertex-partitioning approaches in an application 
would be easier.


Could you please clarify following things for us:
1. Do you plan to continue development of Bagel?
2. Would you be interested in incorporating our graph processing 
interface into Spark if we implement it?
3. Is there any point in contributing BLP partitioner to Spark project 
in some way, e.g. as a Bagel partitioner?

Maybe there are some old versions of libraries on the classpath. Run sbt =
clean and then sbt package again.

Hi Denis,

Thanks for the email. I didn't look at the paper yet so I don't fully
understand your use case. But here are some answers:

1. Do you plan to continue development of Bagel?

Bagel will be subsumed by GraphX when GraphX comes out. We will try to
provide a Bagel API on top of GraphX so existing interfaces don't have to
change.

2. Would you be interested in incorporating our graph processing interface
into Spark if we implement it?

Depending on what it is :) Can the interface be implemented on top of Bagel
or GraphX? Does it benefit a large base of use cases/algorithms or is it
very specific to some algorithms?

If the interface doesn't require changing Spark itself, you can always put
it out on GitHub and let others try the new interface, but creating a new
Spark module would be a pretty major effort. We need to understand what it
does and how it looks like before answering this question. It is a balance
between how big/disruptive the change is, vs how much benefits it brings.


3. Is there any point in contributing BLP partitioner to Spark project in
some way, e.g. as a Bagel partitioner?

See 2. If the BLP partitioner is small and can benefit some common graph
use cases, definitely!

Hi,

Thanks for the youtube video. I wanted to know if people outside UCB, Brown
and VMWare are allowed to contribute?

Hi guys,

I'm new to Spark, so apologies if I've missed something obvious.

I'm investigating the possibility of using Spark from an external UI, and s=
ee that Spark 0.7.0 introduced JSON endpoints into the UI which allows Spar=
k's state to be queried.  I see in MasterWebUI.scala that "/json" and "/app=
/json" map to renderJson functions, but when I hit the url's from a browser=
, I see "No service available for [/json]" and "No service available for [/=
app/json]" respectively.

Is there any documentation on how the end points work, or could someone poi=
nt me in the right direction as to where I can find more information?

Many thanks in advance,
Gordon

Hi Evan,

We plan to do it after Spark 0.8 comes out. You can already find a =
fairly complete work-in-progress version on branch scala-2.10.

In 0.7.X these are actually of the format /app?format=json. In 0.8.X they
will be the format you described here "/app/json". Does that work for you?

Hi Guys,

I am thinking about keeping the users list with Google groups and mirror
the messages to user@spark.i.a.o.

This way users can communicate via Google groups forum style rather than
Apache mailing list,

Most developers contributing to Spark have to use Apache way to communicate
but as for users, we could always let them communicate via Google groups
but mirror the emails (or subscribe user@spark.i.a.o as member of Spark
users Google group).

Thoughts?

- Henry

I'd be happy to do this as long as Apache is okay with it! It will save =
a lot of hassle for our users. Does it basically just require =
subscribing user@spark.i.a.o to the Google Group?

We'll let the other mentors chime in and give their thoughts.
I have been looking at the Apache policy about public listing [1] and could
not find anything about cross posting.

Yeah, like Andy proposed before I am thinking about just subscribing the
user@spark.i.a.o to Google groups and allow Google groups email to send
email to the mailing list.
Not sure what permission Chris set when creating the list but I did allow
the JIRA emails to sent to other Apache list without actually subscribe to
it.

Is Google groups email formatting completely compatible with Apache lists?

Also, if we do it for the users group/list, is there any reason not to do
it for the developers group/list as well? I think most of the developers
also prefer to use Google groups and it would be nice to have the setup of
the two mailing lists be parallel to each other.

Oh, dont get me wrong, there will still be user list but we hopefully could
mirror the content from Google groups mailing list.

As for dev list, it is kind of similar situation but dev list is probably
ok to use mailing list because most people in the list would be more
flexible to not use UI for managing messages.
The reason is because as part of the Apache way, the dev list is the main
channel of communication for discussions and decision making for the
community so I would prefer contributors to use the list directly.

Hi Patrick, that's great. I think I've possibly started a build from
branch-0.7 but have been looking at branch-0.8 code. I'll try the formats
you have described in the morning.

Is there any documentation that outlines all that I could expect to see
returned from the json calls?

Thanks,
Gordon

Hey Gordon,

We don't have a specification of the API right now (in 0.7.X this is a
somewhat experimental feature). Each call returns a set of (k, v) pairs and
the list of keys is static, so you can just do a function call in the
browser to see what it returns and get the schema. The JSON protocol code
is here:

https://github.com/mesos/spark/blob/branch-0.7/core/src/main/scala/spark/deploy/JsonProtocol.scala

For 0.8 this will be more cleanly specified.

- Patrick

Subject: Important: Changes to Spark's build system on master branch
From: Jey Kottalam <jey@cs.berkeley.edu>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

The master branch of Spark has been updated with PR #838, which
changes aspects of Spark's interface to Hadoop. This involved also
making changes to Spark's build system as documented below. The
documentation will be updated with this information shortly.

Please feel free to reply to this thread with any questions or if you
encounter any problems.

-Jey



When Building Spark
===============

- General: The default version of Hadoop has been updated to 1.2.1 from 1.0.4.

- General: You will probably need to perform an "sbt clean" or "mvn
clean" to remove old build files. SBT users may also need to perform a
"clean" when changing Hadoop versions (or at least delete the
lib_managed directory).

- SBT users: The version of Hadoop used can be specified by setting
the SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION environment variable when invoking sbt, and
YARN-enabled builds can be created by setting SPARK_WITH_YARN=true.
Example:

    # Using Hadoop 1.1.0 (a version of Hadoop without YARN)
    SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=1.1.0 ./sbt/sbt package assembly

    # Using Hadoop 2.0.5-alpha (which is a YARN-based version of Hadoop)
    SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=2.0.5-alpha SPARK_WITH_YARN=true ./sbt/sbt
package assembly

- Maven users: Set the Hadoop version built against by editing the
"pom.xml" file in the root directory and changing the "hadoop.version"
property (and, the "yarn.version" property if applicable). If you are
building with YARN disabled, you no longer need to enable any Maven
profiles (i.e. "-P" flags). To build with YARN enabled, use the
"hadoop2-yarn" Maven profile. Example:

- The "make-distribution.sh" script has been updated to take
additional parameters to select the Hadoop version and enable YARN.



When Writing Spark Applications
========================


- Non-YARN users: If you wish to use HDFS, you will need to add the
appropriate version of the "hadoop-client" artifact from the
"org.apache.hadoop" group to your project.

    SBT example:
        // "force()" is required because "1.1.0" is less than Spark's
default of "1.2.1"
        "org.apache.hadoop" % "hadoop-client" % "1.1.0" force()

    Maven example:
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
          <artifactId>hadoop-client</artifactId>
          <!-- the brackets are needed to tell Maven that this is a
hard dependency on version "1.1.0" exactly -->
          <version>[1.1.0]</version>
        </dependency>


- YARN users: You will now need to set SPARK_JAR to point to the
spark-yarn assembly instead of the spark-core assembly previously
used.

  SBT Example:
       SPARK_JAR=$PWD/yarn/target/spark-yarn-assembly-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
        ./run spark.deploy.yarn.Client \
          --jar
$PWD/examples/target/scala-2.9.3/spark-examples_2.9.3-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
\
          --class spark.examples.SparkPi --args yarn-standalone \
          --num-workers 3 --worker-memory 2g --master-memory 2g --worker-cores 1

Thanks,

Hi Henry,

Yes, that is accurate to my knowledge. These changes were merged to
the Github-hosted Spark repository at http://github.com/mesos/spark
today (Aug 20) as part of pull request #838
(https://github.com/mesos/spark/pull/838). The Apache-hosted
repository at https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-spark.git
 does not appear to have these changes.

Hi!

I totally understand the motivation, but I think we may be better
off biting the bullet and doing the migration to the official ASF
infra for MLs. My biggest concern is things like:
    http://www.apache.org/foundation/public-archives.html

I'm sure more senior ASF folks will chime in (if not -- I'll ping them ;-))
but I'll be -0 on this (even though, again, I totally understand
the motivation).

Thanks,
Roman.

Hey Jey,

I'd just like to add that you can also run hadoop2 without modifying the
pom.xml file by passing the hadoop.version property at the command line
like this:

mvn -Dhadoop.version=2.0.0-mr1-cdh4.1.2 clean verify

Also, when you mentioned building with Maven in your instructions I think
you forgot to finish writing out your example for activating the yarn
profile, which I think would be something like:

mvn -Phadoop2-yarn clean verify

...right?

BTW, I've set up the AMPLab Jenkins Spark Maven Hadoop2 project to build
using the new options
https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Spark-Master-Maven-Hadoop2/

Hi Roman,

I personally have no problem to go all the way with migration to ASF lists.
Have been involved with couple projects that move the internal lists and
forum-like support to ADF lists with no problem.

I just started this thread to see if we could start something different
like when git repos are start to be accepted for new ASF projects.
There will be more projects in the future that come from github or google
code that utilizes google groups for channel communication.

For now, as Matei had communicated before, all migrations to ASF lists will
begin on Sept 1 as planned.

- Henry

For what it worth guys - hadoop2 profile content is misleading: CDH isn't
Hadoop2: it has 1354 patches on top of Hadoop2 alpha.

What is called hadoop2-yarn is actually hadoop2. Perhaps, while we are at it
the profiles need to be renamed. I can supply the patch if the community is ok
with it.

hadoop2, in this context, is use of spark on a hadoop cluster without
yarn but with hadoop2 interfaces.
hadoop2-yarn uses yarn RM to launch a spark job (and obviously uses
hadoop2 interfaces).

As Mridul points out, the old "hadoop1" and "hadoop2" terminology
referred to the versions of certain interfaces and classes within
Hadoop. With these latest changes we have unified the handling of both
hadoop1 and hadoop2 interfaces so that the build is agnostic to the
exact Hadoop version available at runtime.

However, the distinction between YARN-enabled and non-YARN builds does
still exist. I propose that we retroactively reinterpret
"hadoop2-yarn" as shorthand for "Hadoop MapReduce v2 (aka YARN)".

I hear you guys - and I am well aware about the differences between the two.
However, actual Hadoop2 doesn't even have such thing as MR1 - this is why
profile naming is misleading. What you see under the current profile 'hadoop2'
is essentially a commercial hack, that doesn't exist anywhere beyond CDH
artifacts (and event there not for long).

Besides, YARN != MR2 :) YARN is a resource manager that, among other things,
provides for running MR applications on it.

We can argue about semantics till blue in the face, but the reality is simple:
current 'hadoop2' profile doesn't reflect Hadoop2 facts. That's my only point.

I understand this Cos, but Jey's patch actually removes the idea of =
"hadoop2". You only set SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION (which can be 1.0.x, =
2.0.0-cdh4, 2.0.5-alpha, etc) and possibly SPARK_YARN_MODE if you want =
to run on YARN.

Looked into the code - totally makes sense now. Sorry for the fuss - was
emailing from my phone being away from a normal computer and access to the

Very good change indeed, thanks Jey!

Hi

	In the current implementation, when running Spark on top of Yarn by spark.=
deploy.yarn.Client, the Spark context is actually running in the Yarn Appli=
cation Master process as a thread. Say not on the node that Client app is i=
nvoke. Which is quite different from the other mode say mesos/standalone/lo=
cal etc.
	I understand that this is not a problem for app that do not involve user i=
nteraction or local file operation. While not working for e.g. spark-shell =
like app. Say https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-527

	And with this yarn mode, the app output is on the node that AM is instance=
d. not easy to be checked.

	So, any particular reason that yarn mode is implemented this way?

	And I just wondering, could we add a mode that the scheduler's Driver acto=
r is still run on local machine, and the Yarn Application Master just launc=
h Executor instead of run the whole user application. Thus a client wrapper=
 app is not needed, and user can just new Spark Context with this mode in l=
ocal. The drawback I can image is that the client node's burden is heavier =
compare to current Yarn mode, but similar to mesos or standalone mode. And =
might also need to handle some fail over issue etc.

	Another approaching might be that, enhance the current wrapper client appl=
ication to proxy all input and output from the app back to the local machin=
e instead of just report the application status. This seems to me not a sou=
nd or easy solution, Especially when local file is involved or third party =
library which have local operation involved.

	Any ideas?

Best Regards,
Raymond Liu

Subject: RDDs with no partitions

So how do these get created, and are we really handling them correctly?
 What is prompting my questions is that I'm looking at making sure that the
various data structures in the DAGScheduler shrink when appropriate instead
of growing without bounds.  Jobs with no partitions and the "zero split
job" test in the DAGSchedulerSuite really throw a wrench into the works.
 That's because in the DAGScheduler we go part way along in handling this
weird case as though it were a normal job submission, we start initializing
or adding to various data structures, etc.; then we pretty much bail out in
submitMissingTasks when we find out that there actually are no tasks to be
done.  We remove the stage from the set of running stages, but we don't
ever clean up pendingTasks, activeJobs, stageIdToStage, stageToInfos, and
others because no tasks are ever submitted for the stage, so there are
never any completion events, nor is the stage aborted -- i.e. the normal
paths to cleanup are never taken.  The end result is that shuffleMap stages
with no partitions (can these even occur?) never complete, and job's with
no partitions would seem also to persist forever.

In short, RDDs with no partitions do really weird things to the
DAGScheduler.

So, if there is no way to effectively prevent the creation of RDDs with no
partitions, is there any reason why we can't short-circuit their handling
within the DAGScheduler so that data structures are never built or
populated for these weird things, or must we add a bunch of special-case
cleanup code to submitMissingStages?

Being the guy that added the empty partition rdd, I second your idea that
we should just short-circuit those in DAGScheduler.runJob.

Hey Guys,

I replied to Matei  about this -- as far as the ASF is concerned, if
it didn't happen on the *ASF* mailing list for the project, then it
didn't happen and thus isn't a decision that binds the project, or that
is defensible from a community perspective.

So let's get that out of the way to start :) Now, beyond that, if folks
prefer to post through Google Groups or use its interface, is it possible
to simply make Google Groups postings to user@spark appear on user@spark?
I would start there (ignore the dev list for now; we need to demonstrate
this
works first on user@ and if it does and doesn't have negative side effects,
then we should try it on dev@). Also I think that the Spark PPMC needs to
set a precedent and ensure that the traffic for the mailing list gets to
the mailing list, and encourage folks that the gold source is @ the ASF.

In short, if there is a way to treat Google Groups as a "client" of the
canonical mail source/"server" at the ASF, then that's OK by me, so long
as the discussion appears here on this list and can be replied to and kept
in context here at the ASF.

Cheers,
Chris

We already do a quick, no-op return from DAGScheduler.runJob when there are
no partitions submitted with the job, so running a job with no partitions
in the usual way isn't a problem.  That still leaves at least the "zero
split job" in the DAGSchedulerSuite and the possibility of shuffleMap
stages with no partitions.  Is "zero split job" testing anything
meaningful, or is its only purpose to cause me headaches?  Can shuffleMap
stages actually have no partitions, or is this (also) a distraction posing
as a legitimate problem?

In short, when are RDDs with no partitions real things that we actually
have to deal with?

We also want to eventually make spark on yarn be able to handle interactive=
 and be more like the standalone deploy where it is more long lived. =A0The=
 first step was to it working for the batch like jobs. =A0So we plan on wor=
king on that later this year. =A0If you are interested in working on it tha=
t would be great. =A0=A0=0A=0AStarting the driver on the local machine is n=
ot scalable. It would quickly overload the launcher boxes and make the laun=
cher(local) boxes very critical. =A0=0A=0ATom=0A=0A=0A_____________________=

 August 22, 2013 12:01 AM=0ASubject: Question about Spark on Yarn design=0A=
 =0A=0AHi=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 In the current implementation, when running Spark =
on top of Yarn by spark.deploy.yarn.Client, the Spark context is actually r=
unning in the Yarn Application Master process as a thread. Say not on the n=
ode that Client app is invoke. Which is quite different from the other mode=
 say mesos/standalone/local etc.=0A=A0=A0=A0 I understand that this is not =
a problem for app that do not involve user interaction or local file operat=
ion. While not working for e.g. spark-shell like app. Say https://spark-pro=
ject.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-527=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 And with this yarn mode,=
 the app output is on the node that AM is instanced. not easy to be checked=
.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 So, any particular reason that yarn mode is implemented th=
is way?=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 And I just wondering, could we add a mode that the s=
cheduler's Driver actor is still run on local machine, and the Yarn Applica=
tion Master just launch Executor instead of run the whole user application.=
 Thus a client wrapper app is not needed, and user can just new Spark Conte=
xt with this mode in local. The drawback I can image is that the client nod=
e's burden is heavier compare to current Yarn mode, but similar to mesos or=
 standalone mode. And might also need to handle some fail over issue etc.=
=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 Another approaching might be that, enhance the current wrap=
per client application to proxy all input and output from the app back to t=
he local machine instead of just report the application status. This seems =
to me not a sound or easy solution, Especially when local file is involved =
or third party library which have local operation involved.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 =
Any ideas?=0A=0ABest Regards,=0ARaymond Liu

I am also having the same issue where a broken captcha prevents my from
registering for the spark jira. Would love to be able to sign up and start
contributing.

But is there any reason to do the handling of those beyond runJob?

One can get 0-partition RDDs (and thus 0-partition stages of either type)
pretty easily with PartitionPruningRDD. Given that, e.g., Shark uses this with
partition statistics, I imagine that real programs can hit the 0-partition
stage case this way.

One can also get a 0-partition RDD from sc.textFile() on an empty directory,
and presumably some uses of hadoopFile/etc., though I won't claim that these
are important to support.

I think the zero-partition RDD might be used in a shuffle with a non-zero
output partition count (e.g. emptyRdd.reduceByKey(f, 1)).

Spark Streaming can also generate RDDs with zero partitions if no data was
received i.e. no data blocks were created in a batch interval. The
resultant BlockRDD for that batch interval will have zero partitions.

This RDD still need to be cogrouped with another RDD (state RDD) and
finally new state RDD needs to be computed (even if there was no input
data).
However, as far as I think, since we are doing a shuffle on the BlockRDD
(for the cogroup) the ShuffledRDD (or whatever its now called) will
non-zero partitions (even though its parent RDD has zero-poartitions). So
this is not really a case of zero partitions and it will actually get
computed in the current code.

TL;DR: From Spark Streaming point of view, even though there are
0-partition RDDs possible, I dont see a point of handling zero partitions
beyond runjob.

Dudes just wanted to saw WOW. Amazing/excellent job on porting the website.

Hey Guys,

Thanks for reporting this - I've disabled CAPTCHA on our sign-up page. It
looks like Atlassian broke this feature in and won't be fixing it until the
next release:
https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-34421.

Could you let me know if you are able to sign up now? Thanks!

- Patrick

Subject: EC2 Script Changes

Hi Everyone,

Today I merged a few improvements to the Spark EC2 scripts to master.
I wanted to take a moment to explain what they are give some more
color on the purpose of these scripts and how we plan to maintain them
going forward. First, the new changes:

- Clusters can be created in any region
- We now support the beefier HVM instance types
- A specific version or git-tag of Spark can be selected when
launching a cluster
- Clusters can now be launched with newer versions of HDFS
- Mesos has been fully replaced with the Standalone scheduler
- There was substantial internal refactoring and clean-up

The purpose of these scripts is to make it extremely easy to create
ephemeral Spark clusters on EC2. In the past this has served two
audiences: (i) new users who want to experiment with Spark on a real
cluster and (ii) developers and researchers testing extensions to
Spark.

Because these are the main goals, we=92ve focused on
ease-of-provisioning and ensuring the cluster environment is as simple
and predictable as possible. This is in part why we=92ve moved from
Mesos to the Standalone scheduler (as many know Spark can run on
Mesos, YARN, and it=92s own simplified scheduler). We also tightly
control the OS, JVM version, installed packages, etc, so we can
support people easily on the mailing list who use this to kick the
tires with Spark.

If you are running older versions of the ec2 scripts, including those
in Spark 0.6/0.7, things will work just as they used to. This only
affects 0.8.0 and newer. I also wanted to note that we may extend
these scripts over time in ways that break *internal* compatibility
with earlier versions. If you are building applications on top of our
ec2 scripts, you should fork the `spark-ec2` repository and maintain
your own copy of the repo (not sure if anyone=92s doing this though=85).

Please feel free to test this out in the next few days and report any
issues to me/the dev list. Hopefully this change will make it easier
for people to get started with Spark even if they have AWS data in
other regions.

Thanks,
- Patrick

Thanks for the advice and insight Chris.

So looks like we could try/ experiment it with user@spark.i.a.o list with
Google group as client to send emails/messages to Apache Spark's user list.

I know we can allow external email address to send emails to user@ list but
I dont think we could manually add Spark's user@ email address as member of
Spark's Google group, or do we?
As Chris has mentioned before, we need to make sure every email sent via
Spark's Google user group will be sent to the user@spark.i.a.o email
address.

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone has thought about putting cached data in an
RDD into off-heap memory, eg. w/ direct byte buffers.  For really
long-lived RDDs that use a lot of memory, this seems like a huge
improvement, since all the memory is now totally ignored during GC.
(and reading data from direct byte buffers is potentially faster as
well, buts thats just a nice bonus).

The easiest thing to do is to store memory-serialized RDDs in direct
byte buffers, but I guess we could also store the serialized RDD on
disk and use a memory mapped file.  Serializing into off-heap buffers
is a really simple patch, I just changed a few lines (I haven't done
any real tests w/ it yet, though).  But I dont' really have a ton of
experience w/ off-heap memory, so I thought I would ask what others
think of the idea, if it makes sense or if there are any gotchas I
should be aware of, etc.

thanks,
Imran

This can be a good idea, especially for large heaps, and the changes for
Spark is potentially fairly small (need to make BlockManager aware of off
heap size and direct byte buffers in its size accounting). This is
especially attractive if the application can read directly from a byte
buffer without generic serialization (like Shark).

One caveat with off-heap storage in the JVM is the OS might not be very
good at dealing with tons of small allocations, but this is not really a
big problem since RDD partitions are supposed to be large in Spark.

Hi Imran,

One possible solution is that you can use
Tachyon<https://github.com/amplab/tachyon>.
When data is in Tachyon, Spark jobs will read it from off-heap memory.
Internally, it uses direct byte buffers to store memory-serialized RDDs as
you mentioned. Also, different Spark jobs can share the same data in
Tachyon's memory. Here is a presentation
(slide<https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffiles.meetup.com%2F3138542%2FTachyon_2013-05-09_Spark_Meetup.pdf>)
we did in May.

I'd need to see a clear and significant advantage to using off-heap RDDs
directly within Spark vs. leveraging Tachyon.  What worries me is the
combinatoric explosion of different caching and persistence mechanisms.
 With too many of these, not only will users potentially be baffled
(@user-list: "What are the performance trade-offs in
using MEMORY_ONLY_SER_2 vs. MEMORY_ONLY vs. off-heap RDDs?  Or should I
store some of my RDDs in Tachyon?  Which ones?", etc. ad infinitum), but
we've got to make sure that all of the combinations work correctly.  At
some point we end up needing to do some sort of caching/persistence manager
to automate some of the choices and wrangle the permutations.

That's not to say that off-heap RDDs are a bad idea or are necessarily the
combinatoric last straw, but I'm concerned about adding significant
complexity for only marginal gains in limited cases over a more general
solution via Tachyon.  I'm willing to be shown that those concerns are
misplaced.

Mark - you don't necessarily need to construct a separate storage level.
One simple way to accomplish this is for the user application to pass Spark
a DirectByteBuffer.

No, you don't necessarily need a separate storage level, but I don't think
you can avoid the "when do I use on-heap RDDs vs. off-heap RDDs vs. RDDs in
Tachyon vs. ...?" questions.  If off-heap RDDs don't gain us a lot over
Tachyon in a lot of use cases, then I'm not sure that they are worth the
extra complexity.  If you can show me how to do them really simply and so
that their appropriate use cases are obvious, then that changes the
calculus.

I remember that I talked about this off-heap approach with Reynold in
person several months ago. I think this approach is attractive to
Spark/Shark, since there are many large objects in JVM. But the main
problem in original Spark (without Tachyon support) is that it uses the
same memory space both for storing critical data and processing temporary
data. Separating storing and processing is more important than looking for
memory-efficient storing technique. So I think this separation is the main
contribution of Tachyon.


As for off-heap approach, we are not the first to realize this problem.
Apache DirectMemory is promising, though not mature currently. However, I
think there are some problems while using direct memory.

1)       Unsafe. As same as C++, there may be memory leak. Users will also
be confused to set right memory-related configurations such as =96Xmx and
=96MaxDirectMemorySize.

2)       Difficult. Designing an effective and efficient memory management
system is not an easy job. How to allocate, replace, reclaim objects at
right time and at right location is challenging. It=92s a bit similar with =
GC
algorithms.

3)       Limited usage. It=92s useful for write-once-read-many-times large
objects but not for others.



I also have two related questions:

1)       Can JVM=92s heap use virtual memory or just use physical memory?

2)       Can direct memory use virtual memory or just use physical memory?

Hi Mike,

I think the Eclipse project is just broken. The SBT-Eclipse plugin isn't =
great. I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA (community edition, which is =
free) -- this is what most of us use. You can do sbt/sbt gen-idea to =
create an IDEA project.

Hi,

We're running Spark on EMR, and are seeing the whole job aborted when a
slave goes down.

What happens is that the slave starts throwing IllegalStateException
"shutdown in progress" errors (see [1]) but Spark thinks this is a
regular application error, so retries the task, which gets scheduled
back to the same node, fails again, repeat 4x, then aborts the job.

So, there are two things I'm wondering about:

1) Can Spark recognize these "shutdown in progress" errors and more
gracefully mark the node as offline? Should this already be handled?

2) It seems like if a task has failed, for any reason, it shouldn't be
sent back to the same node. Especially 4x in a row. At some point the
node should be marked as suspect, and we should try the task somewhere
else. And only if a task has failed on >1 nodes do we fail the job. And
if a node has failed >1 tasks (that then succeeded on other nodes), we
just consider the node dead. Does this seem reasonable?

I'm willing to hack around on either...it's been a few months since
I've poked around in DAGScheduler and I saw a pull requests go by. Just
wondering if maybe these are already handled now. Or if things are in
flux and I should hold off.

Thanks!

- Stephen

Thanks for all the great comments & discussion.  Let me expand a bit
on our use case, and then I'm gonna combine responses to various
questions.

In general, when we use spark, we have some really big RDDs that use
up a lot of memory (10s of GB per node) that are really our "core"
data sets.  We tend to start up a spark application, immediately load
all those data sets, and just leave them loaded for the lifetime of
that process.  We definitely create a lot of other RDDs along the way,
and lots of intermediate objects that we'd like to go through normal
garbage collection.  But those all require much less memory, maybe
1/10th of the big RDDs that we just keep around.  I know this is a bit
of a special case, but it seems like it probably isn't that different
from a lot of use cases.

interesting -- can you explain how this works in Shark?  do you have
some general way of storing data in byte buffers that avoids
serialization?  Or do you mean that if the user is effectively
creating an RDD of ints, that you create a an RDD[ByteBuffer], and
then you read / write ints into the byte buffer yourself?
Sorry, I'm familiar with the basic idea of shark but not the code at
all -- even a pointer to the code would be helpful.

This is a good idea, that I had probably overlooked.  There are two
potential issues that I can think of with this approach, though:
1) I was under the impression that Tachyon is still not really tested
in production systems, and I need something a bit more mature.  Of
course, my changes wouldn't be thoroughly tested either, but somehow I
feel better about deploying my 5-line patch to a codebase I understand
than adding another entire system.  (This isn't a good reason to add
this to spark in general, though, just might be a temporary patch we
locally deploy)
2) I may have misunderstood Tachyon, but it seems there is a big
difference in the data locality in these two approaches.  On a large
cluster, HDFS will spread the data all over the cluster, and so any
particular piece of on-disk data will only live on a few machines.
When you start a spark application, which only uses a small subset of
the nodes, odds are the data you want is *not* on those nodes.  So
even if tachyon caches data from HDFS into memory, it won't be on the
same nodes as the spark application.  Which means that when the spark
application reads data from the RDD, even though the data is in memory
on some node in the cluster, it will need to be read over the network
by the actual spark worker assigned to the application.

Is my understanding correct?  I haven't done any measurements at all
of a difference in performance, but it seems this would be much
slower.

great points, and I have no ideas of the real advantages yet.  I agree
we'd need to actual observe an improvement to add yet another option.
(I would really like some alternative to what I'm doing now, but maybe
tachyon is all I need ...)

hmm, that's true I suppose, but I had originally thought of making it
another storage level, just for convenience & consistency.  Couldn't
you get rid of all the storage levels and just have the user apply
various transformations to an RDD?  eg.

rdd.cache(MEMORY_ONLY_SER)

could be

rdd.map{x =3D> serializer.serialize(x)}.cache(MEMORY_ONLY)


And I agree with all of Lijie's comments that using off-heap memory is
unsafe & difficult.  But I feel that isn't a reason to completely
disallow it, if there is a significant performance improvement.  It
would need to be clearly documented as an advanced feature with some
risks involved.

thanks,
imran

Hi Reynold,

Thanks for your answer. Concerning to second question.

Partitioning could be implemented on top of Bagel, but since Bagel 
interface does not require user to expose data about edges this would 
need some different interface to represent graph data. Adding edge data 
seems more reasonable on level of Bagel, since it allows to add stuff 
like sending messages to all neighbors. In addition, in this case using 
partitioning does not require coding: developer just specifies which 
partitioner to use.

The idea is to change Bagel, so that it has a different interface which 
would allow using partitioning (by adding edge data to interface, 
possibly making interface more similar to GraphX).

One of the problems (which is probably actual for GraphX as well) is how 
to represent vertex identifiers. If we use integers from 0 to N - using 
array to store partition numbers allows to save a lot of space, compared 
to hash tables (which would be required for other vertex ids).  So one 
possibility is a specialized version of Bagel that uses integers from 0 
to N as vertex identifies (+ requires user to expose graph edges). And 
possibly a more general interface on top of it.

As for implementing it on top of GraphX - this does not make much sense 
since BLP partitions vertexes and GraphX partitions edges.

BTW. Are there any estimates when Spark with GraphX will be released? 
Will there be support for in-place modifications in RDDs?


Best,
Denis.

Yes - the user application (in this case) can create a bunch of byte
buffers and doing primitive operations on that directly.

Hi Reynold,

Just wanted to ask a off-heap memory general question since we're on this
topic, do you guys have a way to do memory management of off-heap memory?

I'm also working on Apache Drill and we use Netty's ByteBuffer abstraction
that provides some reference counting mechanisms, but we don't see a good
way to manage and detect how leaks happened.

Tim

This is a legitimate concern. The good news is that, several companies have
been testing it for a while, and some are close to make it to production.
For example, as Yahoo mentioned in today's meetup, we are working to
integrate Shark and Tachyon closely, and results are very promising. It
will be in production soon.

This is a great question. Actually, from data locality perspective, two
approaches have no difference. Tachyon does client side caching, which
means, if a client on a node reads data not on its local machine, the first
read will cache the data on that node. Therefore, all future access on that
node will read the data from its local memory. For example, suppose you
have a cluster with 100 nodes all running HDFS and Tachyon. Then you launch
a Spark jobs running on 20 nodes only. When it reads or caches the data
first time, all data will be cached on those 20 nodes. In the future, when
Spark master tries to schedule tasks, it will query Tachyon about data
locations, and take advantage of data localities automatically.

Best,

Haoyuan

Hi

	Just send a pull request at https://github.com/mesos/spark/pull/868/ for e=
nable spark-shell upon yarn ( https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SP=
ARK-527 ) according to idea I mentioned previously : "add a mode that the s=
cheduler's Driver actor is still run on local machine, and the Yarn Applica=
tion Master just launch Executor instead of run the whole user application.=
 Thus a client wrapper app is not needed, and user can just new Spark Conte=
xt with this mode in local"

Subject: Question about Spark on Yarn design

Hi

	In the current implementation, when running Spark on top of Yarn by spark.=
deploy.yarn.Client, the Spark context is actually running in the Yarn Appli=
cation Master process as a thread. Say not on the node that Client app is i=
nvoke. Which is quite different from the other mode say mesos/standalone/lo=
cal etc.
	I understand that this is not a problem for app that do not involve user i=
nteraction or local file operation. While not working for e.g. spark-shell =
like app. Say https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-527

	And with this yarn mode, the app output is on the node that AM is instance=
d. not easy to be checked.

	So, any particular reason that yarn mode is implemented this way?

	And I just wondering, could we add a mode that the scheduler's Driver acto=
r is still run on local machine, and the Yarn Application Master just launc=
h Executor instead of run the whole user application. Thus a client wrapper=
 app is not needed, and user can just new Spark Context with this mode in l=
ocal. The drawback I can image is that the client node's burden is heavier =
compare to current Yarn mode, but similar to mesos or standalone mode. And =
might also need to handle some fail over issue etc.

	Another approaching might be that, enhance the current wrapper client appl=
ication to proxy all input and output from the app back to the local machin=
e instead of just report the application status. This seems to me not a sou=
nd or easy solution, Especially when local file is involved or third party =
library which have local operation involved.

	Any ideas?

Best Regards,
Raymond Liu

Thanks Haoyuan.  It seems like we should try out Tachyon, sounds like
it is what we are looking for.

No problem. Like reading/writing data from/to off-heap bytebuffer, when a
program reads/writes data from/to Tachyon, Spark/Shark needs to do ser/de.
Efficient ser/de will help on performance a lot as people pointed out. One
solution is that the application can do primitive operations directly on
ByteBuffer, like how Shark is handling it now. Most related code is located
at "
https://github.com/amplab/shark/tree/master/src/main/scala/shark/memstore2"
and "
https://github.com/amplab/shark/tree/master/src/tachyon_enabled/scala/shark=
/tachyon

Hi all,

The incubator website (which is looking great by the way) is telling me to
clone [1] to help out with development.

According to [2] the Apache SVN has been updated recently (< 1 day ago).
For some reason I had [3] down as the repo to get code from, but the Apache
git for Spark hasn't been updated since mid July. I figured since this
moved over from Github that we'd be using git, but it looks like we're
using SVN. Just want to make sure I'm pulling down the correct repo (and
make a JIRA for the link issue if it is in fact a problem).

[1] git://github.com/mesos/spark.git
[2] https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/spark/
[3] https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-spark.git;a=summary

Cheers!

-- Joyce

Hay Michael,

I think you're looking for dev-subscribe@spark.incubator.apache.org as
opposed to just dev@spark.incubator.apache.org

Cheers!

Hey guys,

I would also prefer to strengthen and get behind Tachyon, rather than
implement a separate solution (though I guess if it's not offiically
supported, then nobody will ask questions).  But it's more that off-heap
memory is difficult, so it's better to focus efforts on one project, is my
feeling.

Haoyuan,

Tachyon brings cached HDFS data to the local client.  Have we thought about
the opposite approach, which might be more efficient?
 - Load the data in HDFS node N into the off-heap memory of node N
 - in Spark, inform the framework (maybe via RDD partition/location info)
of where the data is, that it is located in node N
 - bring the computation to node N

This avoids network IO and may be much more efficient for many types of
applications.   I know this would be a big win for us.

-Evan

Hi all,

I noticed that we're still operating in off-Apache JIRA mode. I saw that
there are some problems importing the existing JIRA at [1]. Are we still
waiting on INFRA on this one? Jumping on IRC might help if we are. Anything
I can do to help?

[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6419

Hey guys,

What is the schedule for the 0.8 release?

In general, will the dev community be notified of code freeze, testing
deadlines, doc deadlines, etc.?

I'm specifically looking to know when is the deadline for submitting doc
pull requests.  :)

thanks,
Evan

I sent an email about a week ago saying we're doing a feature freeze and =
only finishing up some of the current tasks (e.g. better build setup for =
linking to Hadoop). I think many of those are now in. The other big =
scary thing left is to change the package name to org.apache.spark.. =
will do that this weekend. When it's done I plan to post a release =
candidate.

Guys, FYI, I'm going to try adding user@spark.i.a.o as a member of the =
Google group, but before that I'll do it temporarily for the dev group =
for testing. (I agree that we should move the dev group permanently to =
Apache). Cross your fingers.

We're going to switch from GitHub to the Apache git repo [3] soon. We've =
been periodically importing stuff there, but I want to have new pull =
requests happen against https://github.com/apache/incubator-spark =
directly once we release 0.8. The Apache SVN is only needed for the =
website, and that's why it has commits.

Sure, I'll see what I can do. Do we have an updated JIRA dump? I'm guessing
I don't have the necessary permissions to get it.

Evan,

If I understand you correctly, you want to avoid network I/O as much as
possible by caching the data on the node having the data on disk. Actually,
what I meant client caching would automatically do this. For example,
suppose you have a cluster of machines, nothing cached in memory yet. Then
a spark application runs on it. Spark asks Tachyon where data X is. Since
nothing is in memory yet, Tachyon would return disk locations for the first
time. Then Spark program will try to take advantage of disk data locality,
and load the data X in HDFS node N into the off-heap memory of node N. In
the future, when Spark asks Tachyon the location of X, Tachyon will return
node N. There is no network I/O involved in the whole process. Let me know
if I misunderstood something.
