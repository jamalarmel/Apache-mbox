Dear podling,

This email was sent by an automated system on behalf of the Apache Incubator PMC.
It is an initial reminder to give you plenty of time to prepare your quarterly
board report.

The board meeting is scheduled for Wed, 17 July 2013, 10:30:00:00 PST. The report 
for your podling will form a part of the Incubator PMC report. The Incubator PMC 
requires your report to be submitted 2 weeks before the board meeting, to allow 
sufficient time for review and submission (Wed, Jul 3rd).

Please submit your report with sufficient time to allow the incubator PMC, and 
subsequently board members to review and digest. Again, the very latest you 
should submit your report is 2 weeks prior to the board meeting.

Thanks,

The Apache Incubator PMC

Submitting your Report
----------------------

Your report should contain the following:

 * Your project name
 * A brief description of your project, which assumes no knowledge of the project
   or necessarily of its field
 * A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards 
   graduation.
 * Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of
 * How has the community developed since the last report
 * How has the project developed since the last report.
 
This should be appended to the Incubator Wiki page at:

  http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/July2013

Note: This manually populated. You may need to wait a little before this page is
      created from a template.

Mentors
-------
Mentors should review reports for their project(s) and sign them off on the 
Incubator wiki page. Signing off reports shows that you are following the 
project - projects that are not signed may raise alarms for the Incubator PMC.

Folks, it seems from the incubator@ list like the deadline for this is =
actually July 10th or so, but I'll work on getting this done tomorrow or =
Thursday. I'll put it on the incubator wiki and send it out when done.

Hey Chris, given that we'll do this, how do we request a =
user@spark.incubator.apache.org list?

Hey Matei,

ASF officers can request the list here:

https://infra.apache.org/officers/mlreq/incubator


I've tried a few times to submit but the form seems
to be down. I'll try again tomorrow.

Cheers,
Chris

Hey Chris, unfortunately I don't have permission to edit the wiki page =
(on my MateiZaharia account), but here is the update in plain text:

------------

Spark

Spark is an open source system for fast and flexible large-scale data =
analysis. Spark provides a general purpose runtime that supports =
low-latency execution in several forms.

Spark has been incubating since 2013-06-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finish bringing up infrastructure on Apache (JIRA, "user" mailing =
list, SVN repo for website)
  2. Migrate mailing lists and development to Apache
  3. Make a Spark 0.8 under the Apache Incubator

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be =
aware of?

While most of our infrastructure is now up, it has taken a while to get =
a JIRA, a SVN repo for our website (so we can use the CMS), and a =
user@spark.incubator.apache.org mailing list (so we can move our =
existing user list, which is large).

How has the community developed since the last report?

We only entered the Apache Incubator at the end of June, but in the =
existing developer community keeps expanding and we are seeing many new =
features from new contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

In terms of the Apache incubation process, we filed our IP papers and =
got a decent part of the infrastructure set up (Git, dev list, wiki, =
Jenkins group).

Date of last release:=20

Please check this [ ] when you have filled in the report for Spark.

Signed-off-by:=20

Dear podling,

This email was sent by an automated system on behalf of the Apache Incubator PMC.
It is an initial reminder to give you plenty of time to prepare your quarterly
board report.

The board meeting is scheduled for Wed, 17 July 2013, 10:30:00:00 PST. The report 
for your podling will form a part of the Incubator PMC report. The Incubator PMC 
requires your report to be submitted 2 weeks before the board meeting, to allow 
sufficient time for review and submission (Wed, Jul 3rd).

Please submit your report with sufficient time to allow the incubator PMC, and 
subsequently board members to review and digest. Again, the very latest you 
should submit your report is 2 weeks prior to the board meeting.

Thanks,

The Apache Incubator PMC

Submitting your Report
----------------------

Your report should contain the following:

 * Your project name
 * A brief description of your project, which assumes no knowledge of the project
   or necessarily of its field
 * A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards 
   graduation.
 * Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of
 * How has the community developed since the last report
 * How has the project developed since the last report.
 
This should be appended to the Incubator Wiki page at:

  http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/July2013

Note: This manually populated. You may need to wait a little before this page is
      created from a template.

Mentors
-------
Mentors should review reports for their project(s) and sign them off on the 
Incubator wiki page. Signing off reports shows that you are following the 
project - projects that are not signed may raise alarms for the Incubator PMC.

Looks great Matei, I signed off!

Did you get access? Looking at:

http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ContributorsGroup


And don't see you there. What's your wiki account username? Let me know
and I'll add you. Sorry just catching up on email now.

Cheers mate!

Chris

My account name is MateiZaharia. I'm pretty sure I had access at some =
point in the past, but I guess I don't. Maybe they added the access =
controls after I joined.

Thanks for signing this off! I also saw you set up a SVN for the CMS, =
which is great. The other thing I'm curious about is the user mailing =
list -- is the thing to set those up working? Once that's up I want to =
announce the transition on our Google groups (I can also do it before if =
needed but I thought it would be nice to do both lists at once).

Hi,

This question might be for scala in general. Which IDE is good for
scala/spark ? I am relatively new to scala. Eclipse throws these weird
errors. I thought I saw IntelliJ IDEA in one of Matei's videos.

Any suggestions ?

Cheers,
Karthik

Hi Karthik,

Are you trying to import Spark into an IDE, or just write a project that =
depends on it?

I've found IDEA works pretty well for importing Spark. You do sbt/sbt =
gen-idea in the Spark folder, then make sure you have the Scala plugin =
in IDEA, and import it. I saw one weird warning about "same path for =
test and production" in the root-build project that I fixed by going to =
the project options and giving a different path for test.

Matei

Hi All,

Since the git repo already created for Apche Spark should all patch
requests go to https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-spark.git with
ASF Jira or pull request to github still accepted?

Hi Henry,

I actually want to do this soon but haven't had the time yet. Hopefully =
we'll announce it in the next few days. I just want to test that the =
GitHub pull request workflow works with this, which I believe it should, =
but it's slightly more complicated because the GitHub repo will be a =
mirror.

Matei

Hi Henry,

This is still waiting on INFRA - =
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6419

Hopefully, they will be able to get to it soon. As soon as it is setup, =
we can query on Matei's question on importing old JIRA issues.=20

Ah cool, Thanks Suresh.

Chris, could you add my username (hsaputra) as initial developers for the

Hi all,

I wanted to bring up a topic that there isn't a 100% perfect solution =
for, but that's been bothering the team at Berkeley for a while: =
consolidating Spark's build system. Right now we have two build systems, =
Maven and SBT, that need to be maintained together on each change. We =
added Maven a while back to try it as an alternative to SBT and to get =
some better publishing options, like Debian packages and classifiers, =
but we've found that 1) SBT has actually been fairly stable since then =
(unlike the rapid release cycle before) and 2) classifiers don't =
actually seem to work for publishing versions of Spark with different =
dependencies (you need to give them different artifact names). More =
importantly though, because maintaining two systems is confusing, it =
would be good to converge to just one soon, or to find a better way of =
maintaining the builds.

In terms of which system to go for, neither is perfect, but I think many =
of us are leaning toward SBT, because it's noticeably faster and it has =
less code to maintain. If we do this, however, I'd really like to =
understand the use cases for Maven, and make sure that either we can =
support them in SBT or we can do them externally. Can people say a bit =
about that? The ones I've thought of are the following:

- Debian packaging -- this is certainly nice, but there are some plugins =
for SBT too so may be possible to migrate.
- BigTop integration; I'm not sure how much this relies on Maven but Cos =
has been using it.
- Classifiers for hadoop1 and hadoop2 -- as far as I can tell, these =
don't really work if you want to publish to Maven Central; you still =
need two artifact names because the artifacts have different =
dependencies. However, more importantly, we'd like to make Spark work =
with all Hadoop versions by using hadoop-client and a bit of reflection, =
similar to how projects like Parquet handle this.

Are there other things I'm missing here, or other ways to handle this =
problem that I'm missing? For example, one possibility would be to keep =
the Maven build scripts in a separate repo managed by the people who =
want to use them, or to have some dedicated maintainers for them. But =
because this is often an issue, I do think it would be simpler for the =
project to have one build system in the long term. In either case =
though, we will keep the project structure compatible with Maven, so =
people who want to use it internally should be fine; I think that we've =
done this well and, if anything, we've simplified the Maven build =
process lately by removing Twirl.

Anyway, as I said, I don't think any solution is perfect here, but I'm =
curious to hear your input.

Hi Matei.

The reason I am using Maven for Bigtop packaging and not SBT is because the
the former's dependency management is clean and let me build a proper assem=
bly
with only relevant dependencies: e.g. no Hadoop if I don't need to, etc.

I don't hold onto the packaging the way it is done in the current maven bui=
ld,
because of the use of the Shader plugin: I believe flattening project
dependencies is a suboptimal way to go.=20

I am glad that you're calling to cease the use of classifiers. Big +1 on th=
at!
Using alternative names or versions to reflect dependency differences is
certainly a great idea!

I, perhaps, don't know much about SBT, but I think it is trying to solve Ma=
ven
rigidity the way the Gradle did. However, the latter is introducing a
well-defined DSL and integrates with Maven/Ant more transparently than SBT
does.

That said, I would love to stick with more mature build system, that is also
wider accepted in Java community. But if the people involved into the proje=
ct
want to go with SBT as a build platform - that will work from Bigtop
standpoint of view as far as we'd able to get a sensible set of libraries f=
or
further packaging (a-la https://github.com/mesos/spark/pull/675).

Hope it helps,
  Cos

Cos, do you have any experience with Gradle by any chance? Is it =
something you'd recommend trying? I do agree that SBT's dependency =
management, being based on Ivy, is not ideal, but I'm not sure how =
common Gradle is and whether it will really work well with Scala.

Hey Matei,

Commit access is controlled by this file [1].
I've checked it out for spark:

[terra:~/tmp/authorization] mattmann% grep spark
asf-authorization-template
[terra:~/tmp/authorization] mattmann%


Looks like nothing there. So I went ahead and updated it:

[terra:~/tmp/authorization] mattmann% svn commit -m "Bootstrap Spark
website karma."
Sending        asf-authorization-template
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 869650.
[terra:~/tmp/authorization] mattmann% grep spark asf-authorization-template
spark=3Dmatei,joshrosen,shivaram,woggle,bobby,tomdz,jasondai,shane_huang,ma=
tt
mann,suresh,rvs
[/incubator/spark]
@spark =3D rw
[terra:~/tmp/authorization] mattmann%


BTW, I've been keeping a Google Doc of the Spark PPMC info (whether
folks have filed an ICLA, their username, etc.) I am going to send it
in a separate thread (the link) -- can folks check that and let me know
if I don't have your info captured in there. For example in tasks
like this, having everyone's username makes it dead simple and knowing
who has submitted ICLAs and who hasn't is really needed.

Thanks!

Cheers,
Chris

Hello cos,

I have a few questions inline!

Isn't this achievable using SBT? I think it should be possible to define
tasksets for that. Then we should be able to do something we do with
maven(mvn -Pwithout-Hadoop) like sbt package-wo-hadoop etc. I am not a SBT
Ninja but I have seen it somewhere it is possible to extend tasks. I guess

two build systems are difficult to maintain with sophisticated build
configurations.

Hi Matai.

I myself would prefer Maven than SBT.

On one hand, from my own experience Maven is better at resolving lib
dependencies.  I used both SBT and Maven to build spark. When I use SBT I
often have to add customized resolvers in build script to make it pass,
while I don't have to do that for maven. (Maybe I missed something here...
I'm not an SBT expert anyway :( )

On the other hand, it seems the open source community is much more familiar
with maven than SBT. If we'd like more people to contribute to Spark, I
think using maven is a good idea.

Thanks,
Shane

Hi Matei,

Thanks for bringing up this build system discussion.

Some CI tools like hudson can support multi Maven profiles via different
jobs so we could deliver different release artifacts for different Maven
profiles.
I believe it should be fine to have Spark-hadoop1 and Spark-haddop2 release
modules.
Just curious how actually SBT avoid/resolve this problem? To support for
different hadoop versions we need to change in the SparkBuild.scala to make
it work.


And as far as maintaining just one build system I am +1 for it. I prefer to
use Maven bc it has better dependency management than SBT.

Thanks,

Henry

Henry, our hope is to avoid having to create two different Hadoop =
profiles altogether by using the hadoop-client package and reflection. =
This is what projects like Parquet (https://github.com/Parquet) are =
doing. If this works out, you get one artifact that can link to any =
Hadoop version that includes hadoop-client (which I believe means 1.2 =
onward).

If you're looking at consolidating build systems, I'd ask to consider ease 
of cross-publishing for different Scala versions.  My instinct is that sbt 
will be less troublesome in that regard (although as I understand it, the 
changes to the repl may present a problem).

We're needing to use 2.10 for a project, so I'd be happy to put in some 
work on the issue.

Unfortunately, we'll probably have to have different branches of Spark =
for different Scala versions, because there are also other libraries we =
depend on (e.g. Akka) that have separate versions for Scala 2.10. You =
can actually find a Scala 2.10 port of Spark in the scala-2.10 branch on =
GitHub.

Thanks for the feedback. It looks like there are more advantages to =
Maven than I was originally thinking of -- specifically, the better =
dependency resolution and assembly construction. (SBT assembly just =
takes all the JARs in lib_managed and packages them together =
unfortunately, which means you sometimes get multiple versions of the =
same artifact if you aren't very careful with exclusion rules). I think =
what we'll do is to wait until we see whether we can have a single Spark =
artifact that works with any Hadoop version, and go back to the build =
system issue then.

There is also an alternative called 'sbt-onejar" we can look at.

Hey everyone,

Join us for the third AMP Camp Big Data Bootcamp, which we will be hosting
at UC Berkeley August 29-30, 2013.

Come to AMP Camp 3 to get hands-on experience with data analytics and
machine learning using Spark, Shark, GraphX, and more.

We have expanded the curriculum from AMP Camps 1 and 2 to include the
newest open-source BDAS projects and we have extended the hands-on
exercises to span both days.

Find details and register at
ampcamp.berkeley.edu/amp-camp-three-berkeley-2013. We expect to sell out
quickly, so grab a spot soon, though the event will also be live streamed
and video archived for free, in case you can't make it.

When you register, use the discount code *canhazmoarspark* and get an extra
$10 off your registration... a little extra love for hanging out on the
Spark dev list.

Finally, spread the word and make sure that all of your friends that you've
been recommending try out Spark register to come as well.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

So I'm currently working in Spark's DAGScheduler and related UI code, and
I'm finding myself wondering why there are StageInfos distinct from Stages.
 It seems like we go through some bookkeeping to make sure that we can get
from a Stage to a StageInfo, which in turn is just a pairing of the Stage
with a collection of (TaskInfo, TaskMetrics) pairs.  Why not avoid the
bookkeeping and just put that collection of (TaskInfo, TaskMetrics) pairs
right in the Stage itself?  I.e., directly change the Stage class to
augment it with the collection instead of indirectly augmenting stages by
going through the (potentially error-prone) mechanics of maintaining an
association between a StageInfo distinct from the Stage.

Or am I missing something?

Hey Mark,

The motivation was to separate internal DAGScheduler data structures, =
such as Stage, from the interface we'll present to SparkListener, which =
will be a semi-public API. (Semi-public in that it might still change if =
we make drastic changes to the scheduler, but we want people to be able =
to use it for monitoring with as little pain as possible). We aren't =
following this consistently in all the SparkListener events yet but the =
goal is to do so.

Ah, got it.  So Stage and TaskInfo are opaque outside spark, while
TaskMetrics are visible.

Hi dev team

(Apologies for a long email!)

Firstly great news about the inclusion of MLlib into the Spark project!

I've been working on a concept and some code for a machine learning library
on Spark, and so of course there is a lot of overlap between MLlib and what
I've been doing.

I wanted to throw this out there and (a) ask a couple of design and roadmap
questions about MLLib, and (b) talk about how to work together / integrate
my ideas (if at all :)

*Some questions*
*
*
1. What is the general design idea behind MLLib - is it aimed at being a
collection of algorithms, ie a library? Or is it aimed at being a "Mahout
for Spark", i.e. something that can be used as a library as well as a set
of tools for things like running jobs, feature extraction, text processing
etc?
2. How married are we to keeping it within the Spark project? While I
understand the reasoning behind it I am not convinced it's best. But I
guess we can wait and see how it develops
3. Some of the original test code I saw around the Block ALS did use Breeze
(https://github.com/dlwh/breeze) for some of the linear algebra. Now I see
everything is using JBLAS directly and Array[Double]. Is there a specific
reason for this? Is it aimed at creating a separation whereby the linear
algebra backend could be switched out? Scala 2.10 issues?
4. Since Spark is meant to be nicely compatible with Hadoop, do we care
about compatibility/integration with Mahout? This may also encourage Mahout
developers to switch over and contribute their expertise (see for example
Dmitry's work at:
https://github.com/dlyubimov/mahout-commits/commits/dev-0.8.x-scala/math-scala,
where he is doing a Scala/Spark DSL around mahout-math matrices and
distributed operations). Potentially even using mahout-math for linear
algebra routines?
5. Is there a roadmap? (I've checked the JIRA which does have a few
intended models etc). Who are the devs most involved in this project?
6. What are thoughts around API design for models?

*Some thoughts*
*
*
So, over the past couple of months I have been working on a machine
learning library. Initially it was for my own use but I've added a few
things and was starting to think about releasing it (though it's not nearly
ready). The model that I really needed first was ALS for doing
recommendations. So I have ported the ALS code from Mahout to Spark. Well,
"ported" in some sense - mostly I copied the algorithm and data
distribution design, using Spark's primitives and Breeze for all the linear
algebra.

I found it pretty straightforward to port over. So far I have done local
testing only on the Movielens datasets. I have found my RMSE results to
match that of Mahout's. Overall interestingly the wall clock performance is
not as dissimilar as I would have expected. But I would like to now do some
larger-scale tests on a cluster to really do a good comparison.

Obviously with Spark's Block ALS model, my version is now somewhat
superfluous since I expect (and have so far seen in my simple local
experiments) that the block model will significantly outperform. I will
probably be porting my use case over to this in due time once I've done
further testing.

I also found Breeze to be very nice to work with and like the DSL - hence
my question about why not use that? (Especially now that Breeze is actually
just breeze-math and breeze-viz).

Anyway, I then added KMeans (basically just the Spark example with some
Breeze tweaks), and started working on a Linear Model framework. I've also
added a simple framework for arg parsing and config (using Twitter
Algebird's Args and Typesafe Config), and have started on feature
extraction stuff - of particular interest will be text feature extraction
and feature hashing.

This is roughly the idea for a machine learning library on Spark that I
have - call it a design or manifesto or whatever:

- Library available and consistent across Scala, Java and Python (as much
as possible in any event)
- A core library and also a set of stuff for easily running models based on
standard input formats etc
- Standardised model API (even across languages) to the extent possible.
I've based mine so far on Python's scikit-learn (.fit(), .predict() etc).
Why? I believe it's a major strength of scikit-learn, that its API is so
clean, simple and consistent. Plus, for the Python version of the lib,
scikit-learn will no doubt be used wherever possible to avoid re-creating
code
- Models to be included initially:
  - ALS
  - Possibly co-occurrence recommendation stuff similar to Mahout's Taste
  - Clustering (K-Means and others potentially)
  - Linear Models - the idea here is to have something very close to Vowpal
Wabbit, ie a generic SGD engine with various Loss Functions, learning rate
paradigms etc. Furthermore this would allow other models similar to VW such
as online versions of matrix factorisation, neural nets and learning
reductions
  - Possibly Decision Trees / Random Forests
- Some utilities for feature extraction (hashing in particular), and to
make running jobs easy (integration with Spark's ./run etc?)
- Stuff for making pipelining easy (like scikit-learn) and for doing things
like cross-validation in a principled (and parallel) way
- Clean and easy integration with Spark Streaming for online models (e.g. a
linear SGD can be called with fit() on batch data, and then fit() and/or
fit/predict() on streaming data to learn further online etc).
- Interactivity provided by shells (IPython, Spark shell) and also plotting
capability (Matplotlib, and Breeze Viz)
- For Scala, integration with Shark via sql2rdd etc.
- I'd like to create something similar to Scalding's Matrix API based on
RDDs for representing distributed matrices, as well as integrate the ideas
of Dmitry and Mahout's DistributedRowMatrix etc

Here is a rough outline of the model API I have used at the moment:
https://gist.github.com/MLnick/6068841. This works nicely for ALS,
clustering, linear models etc.

So as you can see, mostly overlapping with what MLlib already has or has
planned in some way, but my main aim is frankly to have consistency in the
API, some level of abstraction but to keep things as simple as possible (ie
let Spark handle the complex stuff), and thus hopefully avoid things
becoming just a somewhat haphazard collection of models that is not that
simple to figure out how to use - which is unfortunately what I believe has
happened to Mahout.

So the question then is, how to work together or integrate? I see 3 options:

1. I go my own way (not very appealing obviously)
2. Contribute what I have (or as much as makes sense) to MLlib
3. Create my project as a "front-end" or "wrapper" around MLlib as the
core, effectively providing the API and workflow interface but using MLlib
as the model engine.

#2 is appealing but then a lot depends on the API and framework design and
how much what I have in mind is compatible with the rest of the devs etc
#3 now that I have written it, starts to sound pretty interesting -
potentially we're looking at a "front-end" that could in fact execute
models on Spark (or other engines like Hadoop/Mahout, GraphX etc), while
providing workflows for pipelining transformations, feature extraction,
testing and cross-validation, and data viz.

But of course #3 starts sounding somewhat like what MLBase is aiming to be
(I think)!

At this point I'm willing to show out what I have done so far on a
selective basis - be warned though it is rough and not finished and
somewhat clunky perhaps as it's my first attempt at a library/framework, if
it makes sense. Especially because really the main thing I did was the ALS
port, and with MLlib's version of ALS that may be less useful now in any
case.

It may be that none of this is that useful to others anyway which is fine
as I'll keep developing tools that I need and potentially they will be
useful at some point.

Thoughts, feedback, comments, discussion? I really want to jump into MLlib
and get involved in contributing to standardised machine learning on Spark!

Hey Nick,

Thanks for your interest in this stuff! I'm going to let the MLbase team =
answer this in more detail, but just some quick answers on the first =
part of your email:

- =46rom my point of view, the ML library in Spark is meant to be just a =
library of "kernel" functions you can call, not a complete ETL and data =
format system like Mahout. The goal was to have good implementations of =
common algorithms that different higher-level systems (e.g. MLbase, =
Shark, PySpark) can call into.

- We wanted to try keeping this in Spark initially to make it a kind of =
"standard library". This is something that can help ensure it becomes =
high-quality over time and keep it supported by the project. If you =
think about it, projects like R and Matlab are very strong primarily =
because they have great standard libraries. This was also one of the =
things we thought would differentiate us from Hadoop and Mahout. =
However, we will of course see how things go and separate it out if it =
needs a faster dev cycle.

- I haven't worried much about compatibility with Mahout because I'm not =
sure Mahout is too widely used and I'm not sure its abstractions are =
best. Mahout is very tied to HDFS, SequenceFiles, etc. We will of course =
try to interoperate well with data from Mahout, but at least as far as I =
was concerned, I wanted an API that makes sense for Spark users.

- Something that's maybe not clear about the MLlib API is that we also =
want it to be used easily from Java and Python. So we've explicitly =
avoided having very high-level types or using Scala-specific features, =
in order to get something that will be simple to call from these =
languages. This does leave room for wrappers that provide higher-level =
interfaces.

In any case, if you like this "kernel" design for MLlib, it would be =
great to get more people contributing to it, or to get it used in other =
projects. I'll let the MLbase folks talk about higher-level interfaces =
-- this is definitely something they want to do, but they might be able =
to use help. In any case though, sharing the low-level kernels across =
Spark projects would make a lot of sense.

BTW I should also add about Mahout that it might also make sense for =
Mahout to call MLlib internally. I just haven't looked into it enough to =
decide whether we'd want to provide more than input/output wrappers. But =
it would certainly be great to have Mahout people help out with MLlib in =
some way.

Matei addressed this from a higher level. I want to provide a little bit
more context. A common properties of a lot of high level Scala DSL
libraries is that simple operators tend to have high virtual function
overheads and also create a lot of temporary objects. And because the level
of abstraction is so high, it is fairly hard to debug / optimize
performance.

Hi Nick,

Thanks for your email, and it's great to see such excitement around this
work!  Matei and Reynold already addressed the motivation behind MLlib as
well as our reasons for not using Breeze, and I'd like to give you some
background about MLbase, and discuss how it may fit with your interests.

There are three components of MLbase:

1) MLlib: As Matei mentioned, this is an ML library in Spark with core ML
kernels and solid implementations of common algorithms that can be used
easily by Java/Python and also called into by higher-level systems (e.g.
MLI, Shark, PySpark).

2) MLI: this is an ML API that provides a common interface for ML
algorithms (the same interface used in MLlib), and introduces high-level
abstractions to simplify feature extraction / exploration and ML algorithm
development.  These abstractions leverage the kernels in MLlib when
possible, and also introduce additional kernels.  This work also includes a
library written against the MLI.  The MLI is currently written against
Spark, but is designed to be platform independent, so that code written
against MLI could be run on different engines (e.g., Hadoop, GraphX, etc.).


3) ML Optimizer: This piece automates the task of model selection.  The
optimizer can be viewed as a search problem over feature extraction /
algorithms included in the MLI library, and is in part based on efficient
cross validation. This work is under active development but is in an
earlier stage of development than MLlib and MLI.

(note: MLlib will be included with the Spark codebase, while the MLI and ML
Optimizer will live in separate repositories.)

As far as I can tell (though please correct me if I've misunderstood) your
main goals include:

i) "consistency in the API"
ii) "some level of abstraction but to keep things as simple as possible"
iii) "execute models on Spark ... while providing workflows for pipelining
transformations, feature extraction, testing and cross-validation, and data
viz."

The MLI (and to some extent the ML Optimizer) is very much in line with
these goals, and it would be great if you were interested in contributing
to it.  MLI is a private repository right now, but we'll make it public
soon though, and Evan Sparks or I will let you know when we do so.

Thanks again for getting in touch with us!

-Ameet

Hi

Ok, that all makes sense. I can see the benefit of good standard libraries
definitely, and I guess the pieces that felt "missing" to me were what you
are describing as MLI and MLOptimizer.

It seems like the aims of MLI are very much in line with what I have/had in
mind for a ML library/framework. It seems the goals overlap quite a lot.

I guess one "frustration" I have had is that there are all these great BDAS
projects, but we never really know when they will be released and what they
will look like until they are. In this particular case I couldn't wait for
MLlib so ended up doing some work myself to port Mahout's ALS and of course
have ended up duplicating effort (which is not a problem as it was
necessary at the time and has been a great learning experience).

Similarly for GraphX, I would like to develop a project for a Spark-based
version of Faunus (https://github.com/thinkaurelius/faunus) for batch
processing of data in our Titan graph DB. For now I am working with
Bagel-based primitives and Spark RDDs directly, but would love to use
GraphX, but have no idea when it will be released and have little
involvement until it is.

(I use "frustration" in the nicest way here - I love the BDAS concepts and
all the projects coming out, I just want them all to be released NOW!! :)

So yes I would love to be involved in MLlib and MLI work to the extent I
can assist and the work is aligned with what I need currently in my
projects (this is just from a time allocation viewpoint - I'm sure much of
it will be complementary).

Anyway, it seems to me the best course of action is as follows:

   - I'll get involved in MLlib and see how I can contribute there. Some
   things that jump out:


   - implicit preference capability for ALS model since as far as I can see
      currently it handles explicit prefs only? (Implicit prefs here:
      http://68.180.206.246/files/HuKorenVolinsky-ICDM08.pdf which is
      typically better if we don't have actual rating data but instead "view",
      "click", "play" or whatever)
      - RMSE and other evaluation metrics for ALS as well as test/train
      split / cross-val stuff?
      - linear model additions, like new loss functions for hinge loss,
      least squares etc for SGD, as well as learning rate stuff (
      http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6646) and regularisers (L1/L2/Elasic Net) -
      i.e. bring the SGD stuff in line with Vowpal Wabbit / sklearn (if that's
      desirable, my view is yes)
      - what about sparse weight and feature vectors for linear models/SGD?
      Together with hashing allows very large models while still being
efficient,
      and with L1 reg is particularly useful.
      - finally what about online models? ie SGD models currently are
      "static" ie once trained can only predict, whereas SGD can of course keep
      learning. Or does one simply re-train with the previous initial weight
      vector (I guess that can work just as well)... Also on this
topic training
      / predicting on Streams as well as RDDs
   - I can put up what I have done to a BitBucket account and grant access
   to whichever devs would like to take a look. The only reason I don't just
   throw it up on GitHub is that frankly it is not really ready and is not a
   fully-fledged project yet (I think anyway). Possibly some of this can be
   useful (not that there's all that much there apart from the ALS (but it
   does solve for both explicit and implicit preference data as per Mahout's
   implementation), KMeans (simpler than the one in MLlib as I didn't yet get
   around to doing KMeans++ init) and the arg-parsing / jobrunner (which may
   or may not be interesting both for ML and for Spark jobs in general)).

Let me know your thoughts
Nick

I was *kinda* worried about it too.

But like it often happens, it would seem to me we are worrying about
somethign that will never compare with the bulk computation.

Consider this fragment (it is from one of the flavors of weighted ALS with
weighted regularization) :


        val cholArg =  icVtV + (vBlockForC.t %*%: diagv(d)) %*% vBlockForC
+ diag(n_u * lambda, k)


yes we  just created a few object references here for GC with scala
implicit conversions while having million flops behind the scene sent to
FPU meanwhile AND we  have optimized left-multiply (%*%: operator)  with a
diagonal matrix as well as made use of symmetric matrix optimizations in a
very scala way. And it looks just like what R folks would understand. The
benefits of DSL clearly outweigh whatever claimed overhead exists IMO.
Can't deny i find it subjectively more elegant than
vblock.transpose().times(....new DiagonalMatrix (n_u*lambda,k) ... )


As far as Mahout abstraction quality (and i am assuming we are talking
about in-core lin alg support here, cause there's much more else), this is
debatable but that's why i actually started doing DSL in the first place.
DSL should iron a lot of that out, as we have seen, and bring it closer to
R/matlab look&feel.

But there are other important factors about Mahout's in-core support.

I did my honest homework for my project trying to pick on in-core linear
algebra, and i was not stuck on Mahout in-core support at all. I actually
really wanted to find something a bit more mature for in-core algebra.

In my search, I failed to find a project to address the following two major
problems for in-core BLAS:

1) naturally embedded support for sparse matrices and optimizations aimed
degenerate nature of zero elements. No other project quite doing it to the
same degree. apache-math sparse matrices are deprecated and said to be
broken. JBLAS/ LAPACK doesn't have degenerate element optimizations at all.
Breeze lacks consistency in Matrix abstraction between sparse and dense
matrices. etc. etc.

2) Kind of extension of the 1, wide range of matrix support optimized for
various speicific solver computations -- diagonal, upper/lower triangulars,
symmetric parsimonious, pivoted, rowwise vs. column wise vs. open addressed
sparse matrices etc. etc. especially with the latest effort there. Nobody
came close to that variety and ease of sparse operation optimizations in my
(however brief) search.

it is kinda raw at times, but nothing that i can't handle.

But i totally agree that any sort of such environment is not part of spark.
It makes some pragmatic tasks very addressable though and i can see a
roadmap where i could mix Mahout's distributed solvers with sparks freely
until i have a chance to port/create more what i need on spark side without
any additional format/conversion issues.

Hi Nick,

I can understand your 'frustration' -- my hope is that having discussions
(like the one we're having now) via this mailing list will help mitigate
duplicate work moving forward.

Regarding your detailed comments, we are aiming to include various
components that you mentioned in our release (basic evaluation for
collaborative filtering, linear model additions, and basic support for
sparse vectors/features).  One particularly interesting avenue that is not
on our immediate roadmap is adding implicit feedback for matrix
factorization.  Algorithms like SVD++ are often used in practice, and it
would be great to add them to the MLI library (and perhaps also MLlib).

-Ameet

I fully agree that we need to be clearer with the timelines in AMP Lab. =
One thing is that many of these are still research projects, so it's =
hard to predict when they will be ready for prime-time. Usually with all =
the things we officially announce (e.g. MLlib, GraphX), and especially =
the things we put in the Spark codebase, the team behind them really =
wants to make them widely available and has committed to spend the =
engineering to make them usable in real applications (as opposed to =
prototyping and moving on). But even then it can take some time to get =
the first release out. Hopefully we'll improve our communication about =

Cool I totally understand the constraints you're under and it's not really =
a criticism at all - the amplab projects are all awesome!


If I can find ways to help then all the better

One thing is that many of these are still research projects, so it's hard =
to predict when they will be ready for prime-time. Usually with all the =
things we officially announce (e.g. MLlib, GraphX), and especially the =
things we put in the Spark codebase, the team behind them really wants to =
make them widely available and has committed to spend the engineering to =
make them usable in real applications (as opposed to prototyping and moving=
 on). But even then it can take some time to get the first release out. =
Hopefully we'll improve our communication about this through more careful =
tracking in JIRA.

Subject: Licensing for PySpark's CloudPickle Module

PySpark's CloudPickle library was originally developed by PiCloud (
http://www.picloud.com/) and distributed under a non-BSD license.  I
contacted them last year and they agreed to let us bundle the CloudPickle
module under a BSD license.  Now that Spark is moving to an Apache license,
how does this impact this module?  What license will apply to future
changes to this module?  Do we need to obtain additional licensing from the
PiCloud folks?  I've attached my original correspondence with PiCloud, in
case that helps.

I ask because I'm interested in making some fixes to the cloudpickle code
and I'd like to collaborate with the PiCloud folks, if possible, since
they're more familiar with that code and may be interested in some of the
bugs that I've found.

Thanks,
Josh Rosen

Hi Aaron,

I'm just interested in cloudpickle.py, debugpickle.py, and their small
dependencies.  We'll develop our own module transfer / dependency
deployment system or build on existing systems in Spark or Mesos, so I
don't need to use other code from PiCloud.

The CloudPickle module has been very useful and I appreciate your help with
the licensing.  I'll bundle cloudpickle.py and its dependencies with
PySpark and add the proper attribution in the docstring.

Thanks for your help,
Josh Rosen

Hi Josh,

How much of the functionality do you need to utilize?

If we are just talking cloudpickle.py and debugpickle.py (and their small
dependencies; 2 functions the cloudpickler uses from util and the
xmlhandlers library used by pickledebug), we are fine with you moving that
into your own code and re-releasing it under the BSD license. Just modify
the license the license in the source code; all we ask is that you
attribute the original work to PiCloud, Inc. and provide a link to our
website in the top level comments of the modules.

If you are looking for all of the functionality relating to getting code
running on X machine to Y machine (module transfer, some of the import
hacks in adapter, etc.), that's a whole different matter. It's difficult to
pull it out of PiCloud itself as a separate package, due to it being spread
across so many modules.  Are just the picklers enough?

Thanks,
Aaron Staley

Hi Josh,

BSD is a Category-A approved license at the ASF:

http://www.apache.org/legal/3party.html#category-a

Meaning it can be incorporated in Apache projects.

HTH!


Cheers,
Chris

Hi all!

My name is Michael Joyce. I work at JPL and have heard some great things
about Spark from Chris Mattmann. I figured I would stop by, say hello, and
hopefully throw some helpful contributions at the project.

Look forward to helping out!

Hey Michael,

Glad to hear you're interested in helping. Are there specific things =
you'd like to work on? Certainly we will need help with various Apache =
packaging, etc so it's good to have more people with experience at =
Apache.

Hay Matei,

Truth be told I haven't had much of a chance to look through JIRA and the
code base to pick a specific part to work on. Is there anything in
particular that needs some work? I'm more than happy to throw some effort
at a specific problem if something needs attention. Otherwise I can just
poke around and try to find a nice niche in which to work so I can help out.

Thanks much!

-- Joyce

Hey Michael,

Depending on your background, there are quite a few things to do.

One general area that we might use more help for, if you have experience =
there, is the Python API. Part of it can be just to add more examples in =
Python, e.g., to show how one can use NumPy or SciPy with it. Another =
thing that would be super useful if you also have access to Windows is =
this: https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-649. We want to =
make Spark very broadly accessible for science work and it sounds like =
your background at JPL is good for that.

Alternatively, if you prefer to work on the Java VM, there are a bunch =
of internal things to do there too -- I can give an overview of what I'd =
consider easy to jump into there.

Matei

Hay Matei,

I would love to help on the Python API. I'll start taking a look at that.
Unfortunately I don't have access to a Windows computer, so I can't be of
much use there. I would also be more than happy to work on the JVM stuff as
well. If you have a list stuff to do there (or it wouldn't take too long to
compile one), I would gladly take a look.

Thanks for all the help!

Subject: fixed hbase version in SparkBuild (spark-0.8)

Hello,

after couple of days(!) of trying to understand where i get the
"NoSuchMethod" error, i traced it down to the fact that 0.8 now includes
hbase.

While it is assumed that hadoop version is specified, hbase version is
fixed. This seem to create problem if hbase is used with a particular
version of CDH hadoop client in the backend. (there's a known compatibility
bug).

wouldn't it make sense in this case to allow to declare hbase version as
well, perhaps even tie it to the CDH version?

At the very least i think it deserves a specific mention in the header
section to provide opportunity to override, just like hadoop version does?

Thanks.

Let's at the very least make it configurable, but an even better thing =
will be to make sbt assembly not include it. I think the only thing that =
depends on HBase is the examples project, but unfortunately SBT puts all =
its JARs in the lib_managed folder and just stupidly creates an assembly =
by grouping those. The Maven build, for example, should not do that.

Cool! The way I'd start is perhaps by adding a new Python example job. =
For example, a good one to implement would be PageRank -- you can look =
at these slides for a Scala version of it: =
http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/matei-zaharia-part-=
2-amp-camp-2012-standalone-programs.pdf. Another possibility is linear =
regression. But feel free to also come up with your own.

There are also a number of Python issues open relating to adding some =
missing API features, but these require a more thorough understanding of =
how PySpark work and possibly some hacking around in pickled data: =
https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-791?jql=3Dcomponent%20%3D=
%20PySpark%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open . The easiest one to start with =
is probably SPARK-838.

It is very easy to exclude dependencies in Maven assembly, like it is done =

Yeah, and maybe we will want to change to Maven as the recommended tool =
for assembly building. I want to look into this more for the 0.8 =
release.

Matei,

Hbase dependencies aren't actually included into the Maven assembly as of t=
his
moment, because scope of hbase dependency in examples' module is "compile";=
 but
the assembly is only includes those with "runtime". Hence it is automatical=
ly
excluded.

I believe, hbase is needed for examples during the execution time, and if s=
o -
it would have to be fixed in the module. This will lead to need to exclude =
it
=66rom the assembly, in turn.

And of course... :)

Yeah, that is true. But the assembly shouldn't include the examples =
project at all IMO -- if it does now, we should remove it.

Basically the way to think of the assembly is that it should have =
libraries that users' client programs need to run. These are core, repl =
(needed if they use the shell), and likely bagel and streaming and =
mllib, though originally we'd opted to leave those out. We are still =
deciding on that -- could go either way.

Ok, that makes sense, although I thought examples might be a good part of t=
he
documentation for the beginners' references, etc. But I have problems modif=
ying
the assembly accordingly. Will do it the first thing in the morning.

Thanks for the input.

Dmitriy,

lib_managed/ is controlled by sbt build - Maven uses ~/.m2/repository
directly. Hence, earlier Matei point stands on the need to fix it in sbt
build.

I am not sure why would Cloudera solve the issue in the Spark build? :)

I wasn't saying =D0=A1loudera  should. I just meant to say i saw other peop=
le
stranded out there on that very issue right now while searching for the
cause. This incompatibility bug is not at all obvious to track.

Ok i guess it should be ok for sbt build to declare HBASE_VERSION and use
it.

I also discovered that cdh hbase counterpart does not seem to be published
to any repository spark uses (unlike hadoop client jars). So to resolve, i
also had to add a direct cloudera resolver. it is probably more than you
want to do for spark, but any person using hbase and cdh would probably run
into this surprisingly hard to track issue.

Well, dependency clashes are a hell to trace. Maven has this dependency:tree
way of presenting all the project deps. in a graph form, but still it is a
pain in the neck.

I am about to roll out a fix for maven assembly to exclude examples from the
assembly.

As for the 3rd party repo (just my two cents): not sure about sbt, but in case
of Maven it can easily be handled by local users' settings.xml profiles and
repos, rather than be hardcoded in the project. Otherwise, the build
system might end up with more and more 3rd party distros' repositories being
included, which leads to mess, confusion, etc.

Interestingly, mllib isn't even getting built by maven... I will address it as
a separate patch then.
