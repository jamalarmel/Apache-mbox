Hi Spark peeps!

FYI below -- can someone please audit the Git repo and make sure it
looks good then comment back on INFRA-6418 when done so that David
can make it writeable? At that point you'll have a writeable Git repo
for the podling at the ASF and can start devving there.

Thanks!

Cheers,
Chris

Thanks Matei I just replied there -- he can make it writeable now
and close the issue since the ASF copyrights and other things can
be added to the files during Incubation and before our first release.

We're good!

Cheers,
Chris

This is great.

Quick question about mailing lists: Spark also has a
spark-users<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spark-users>
google
group. Can we also get a users@spark.i.a.o mailing list to have somewhere
to migrate that group? Do I need to create an infra issue for this?

Also, we should discuss a strategy, and timeline for migrating the mailing
lists over to the new ones.

As far as a strategy, here are the steps I can think of that will help make
for a smooth transition:

   1. Request users list on apache infra (done)
   2. Pick a day/time for the switch (how about July 1, assuming
   users@spark.i.a.o is set up by then)
   3. At Switch time:
      1. Make announcements on the dev and users mailing lists with links
      to the new lists, instructions on how to subscribe, and a note saying all
      conversations are moving over to that list.
      2. Update the website with links to the new lists
      3. Enable an auto responders on those lists with pointers to the new
      apache lists

Anything else?

Andy

Yeah, similarly to the users list, we asked for a "commits" one on the =
incubator proposal, where we'll hopefully set up Git to email commit =
messages. Do we have to request these specifically with JIRAs on INFRA?

Re a commits email list, Henry said that a commits list was created and I
was able to subscribe to it so it seems like it exists. However, it isn't
showing up at http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ but maybe
that's because no email has been sent to it yet (thus no archives).

And when i tried sending an email to it, I got a bounce (see below) but it
looks like it bounced because it only accepts emails from @apache.org email
addresses (and I sent from my gmail address).

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at apache.org.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

It isn't showing up at http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ but maybe
that's because no email has been sent to it yet (thus no archives).

Hi Andy,

Usually new Apache incubator has dev@ list without users@ to make sure all
the effort and discussion focused in one mailing list. But Spark, and like
several other podlings, already have enough users that warrant creation of
users@ list.

I am +1 to create that list if all think that its the way to go.

- Henry

Ah, got it. I'd prefer not to do this actually because we already had =
separate dev and issues lists before we moved to Apache. It could be =
annoying for people to add new filters that deal with them as one list.

OK, cool yeah I think I requested commits and dev as lists earlier, but
didn't request a user one. To request a new list, you go here:

https://infra.apache.org/officers/mlreq/incubator


Did you request a list yet? Should i?

(BTW sorry about the delay in responding was at a DARPA meeting all week in
DC an am just back in California now catching up on everything).

Perfect! That's correct Andy.

Hi Matei,

Nope it will automatically get mapped to those lists so please let me know
if you are Git committing but not seeing them go to the lists and I will
double check with infra@ Similarly, JIRA issues should go to dev.

Chris

+ spark-developers@googlegroups.com to loop in those who haven't subscribed
to dev@spark.i.a.o yet, (also because my emails are getting bounced by
Apache's spam filters).

I wanted to respond here in the conversation about the mailing list
migration that was happening on the email thread called "Re: A wiki for
Spark (on Apache infra)"...

Assuming that we Apache requires us to migrate from google groups to lists
on Apache infra, we might consider waiting to migrating the users list to
apache infra until after we graduate to a TLP, so that we only have to
migrate it once.

Here's why. I assume with each list migration that requires subscribers to
do work, we will lose some subscribers. If we ask them to migrate to an
incubator user list now and then again to yet a different list when we
graduate to a TLP (which we hope to do fairly quickly), it seems like we
will irritate and lose strictly more subscribers.

This requirement to migrate infra twice as part of moving to Apache seems a
bit hard on communities. It also seems like a requirement that will go away
if the changes you are pushing for to the incubation process (i.e. podling
TLPs) actually ever happen.

Anyway, I see our options as:

1. Migrate only the dev list now (since this is a smaller core group that
is more likely to migrate with us) and wait to create an apache users list
until we graduate and migrate from the users google group then. Con: it's
confusing to have user and dev lists on different infra.
2. Move the users list now, in which case we go with the migration plan I
proposed earlier. Con: migrating users list twice = more irritating to
users.

Hi Andy,

Its strongly advisable to have all the lists on ASF infrastructure. The =
only reason the incubators are not encouraged against users list is to =
keep the community together. But if spark already had a user base and =
the projects wants to have a user list, you should go for it. That will =
be way less confusing.=20

If there are no objections, I can request a user list.=20

I think we should avoid migrating the list too many times, especially the
user list.

Also - are there any rules regarding maintaining a separate, non-Apache
mailing list by 3rd party? Google Groups has been very convenient for
users, both in terms of the UX and the way to quickly and easily search for
archived messages.

Hi Suresh,

The request here is actually to *not* use the Apache user list while in the
incubator. The issue is that we don't want to ask almost 1000 people to
migrate twice between two different lists in a short period of time. That
seems like the most confusion of all options.

If there is a requirement that eventually we get all lists over to apache,
then so be it. But having a double migration is something I'd personally
strongly object to and I feel that others in the community would also
object to this.

Let's just defer the migration of the users list until we graduate to a TLP
- this is a completely sensible option and will be easy to explain to the
broader user community.

- Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Thanks for clarifying I think I get it now. So the issues is users =
having to migrate now to  user@spark.incubator.apache.org and later to =
dev@spark.apache.org? Thats less of a worry in my opinion. Because once =
the project graduates, the incubator list auto redirect to TLP list. =
Users will slowly change it themselves. I agree migrating from google =
groups to ASF list will be a big one.=20

I think we should have lots of lessons learned from Open Office dealing =
with magnitude more number of users.=20

Hi Andy et al.,

Why don't we just collect the current subscribers to the Google Group,
get them to me, and I'll subscribe them to the ASF new lists? I'm happy
to create a user list here at the ASF for the project, and to migrate
the users. Then all they would have to do is remember to use the new
email when addressing. A change, yes, I know, but still a minimal one.

That OK?

Cheers,
Chris

Hi Chris,

There are a lot of user preferences set by them (e.g. individual emails vs
batch) that wouldn't work when you just "import". If user list is not an
absolute requirement for the incubator, it would make sense to delay
the migration of user lists until we are graduating to a TLP.

Hey Reynold,

I hear your pain - trust me I do - but at the same time it doesn't
make sense to half complete bringing the community over. Mailing list
conversation (especially user oriented ones) are one of the core
portions of open source communities at least in my experience.

There are not really many hard requirements here at the ASF -- there
are social norms and memes and old fuddy duddies like me who share
those memes and information with people to try and encourage open
source best practice, while at the same time trying not to disturb
all the awesomeness going on that you guys are leading.

With that, how many users are we talking about on the user mailing
list at this point? Can you give me an exact count?

I'm willing to spend the time to get people migrated now. Then,
migrating later from user@spark.incubator.apache.org to
user@spark.apache.org
will be really less of a hassle and a lot less difficult since we
are really moving from ezmlm to ezmlm. Also with the $podling.i.a.o
namespace I think even now we can use spark.apache.org (*think*)
which in turn could cause even less hassle later. In addition, like
I said, when we graduate to TLP I'll also be happy to contribute
time towards making the migration as seamless as possible.

Cheers,
Chris

Hey Chris,

I definitely understand that we need to move to Apache lists, and I =
think that's fine, but maybe one question -- is it possible to transform =
the *@spark.incubator.apache.org lists into *@spark.apache.org more =
seamlessly when we graduate? It's weird to ask users to move twice. If =
these could somehow become aliases that would be ideal.

In any case though, I think we'll have a gradual transition. I'd first =
move the dev list over, then the user one, and for a while I'd keep both =
and keep a notice on the Google group. I'm not sure how Google groups =
allow that but there must be a way.

Matei

Hi Andy,

Thanks for sharing. That's quite a few indeed. Like I said, I'm happy
to help, I'd imagine the steps would be:

1. Notice email to spark-developers@googlegroups.com that by XXX date
(mid July, mid August?) that the project will shift its focus to answering
questions
on user@spark.i.a.o.

2. #1 will give people time to start migrating. If you
want to give me a list of emails I can subscribe them to the new user list.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Chris

Hey Chris,

I definitely understand that we need to move to Apache lists, and I =
think that's fine, but maybe one question -- is it possible to transform =
the *@spark.incubator.apache.org lists into *@spark.apache.org more =
seamlessly when we graduate? It's weird to ask users to move twice. If =
these could somehow become aliases that would be ideal.

In any case though, I think we'll have a gradual transition. I'd first =
move the dev list over, then the user one, and for a while I'd keep both =
and keep a notice on the Google group. I'm not sure how Google groups =
allow that but there must be a way.

Matei

Hey Matei,

Yep the below is exactly what I suggested to Andy (per your plan below).

And yep I think with the $p.i.a.o namespace the transition is pretty
seamless and doesn't require much from the users.

Cheers,
Chris

I've created this INFRA issue requesting a Spark Confluence wiki
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6475 and made it a sub-task of
the umbrella INFRA issue tracking all of the podling bootstrapping tasks
(i.e., https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6417 ).
