Hey All,

There is a small API change that we are considering for the external
sort patch. Previously we allowed mergeCombiner to be null when map
side aggregation was not enabled. This is because it wasn't necessary
in that case since mappers didn't ship pre-aggregated values to
reducers.

Because the external sort capability also relies on the mergeCombiner
function to merge partially-aggregated on-disk segments, we now need
it all the time, even if map side aggregation is enabled. This is a
fairly esoteric thing that I'm not sure anyone other than Shark ever
used, but I want to check in case anyone had feelings about this.

The relevant code is here:

I added the option that doesn't require the caller to specify the
mergeCombiner closure a while ago when I wanted to disable mapSideCombine.
In virtually all use cases I know of, it is fine & easy to specify a
mergeCombiner, so I'm all for this given it simplifies the codebase.

Yup, I=92ll write it up soon.

The main thing missing for us is unfortunately still the JIRA import =97 =
let=92s see if we can get some help with that, since I think we have at =
least one version that is importable. If you know anyone who can do this =
please point them to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6419.

Dear podling,

This email was sent by an automated system on behalf of the Apache Incubator PMC.
It is an initial reminder to give you plenty of time to prepare your quarterly
board report.

The board meeting is scheduled for Wed, 15 January 2014, 10:30:30:00 PST. The report 
for your podling will form a part of the Incubator PMC report. The Incubator PMC 
requires your report to be submitted 2 weeks before the board meeting, to allow 
sufficient time for review and submission (Wed, Jan 1st).

Please submit your report with sufficient time to allow the incubator PMC, and 
subsequently board members to review and digest. Again, the very latest you 
should submit your report is 2 weeks prior to the board meeting.

Thanks,

The Apache Incubator PMC

Submitting your Report
----------------------

Your report should contain the following:

 * Your project name
 * A brief description of your project, which assumes no knowledge of the project
   or necessarily of its field
 * A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards 
   graduation.
 * Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of
 * How has the community developed since the last report
 * How has the project developed since the last report.
 
This should be appended to the Incubator Wiki page at:

  http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/January2014

Note: This manually populated. You may need to wait a little before this page is
      created from a template.

Mentors
-------
Mentors should review reports for their project(s) and sign them off on the 
Incubator wiki page. Signing off reports shows that you are following the 
project - projects that are not signed may raise alarms for the Incubator PMC.

Alright, I=92ve posted an update at =
https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/January2014.

If we can=92t get the JIRA imported soon, my suggestion would be just to =
skip importing the old issues and start the ones here at a higher issue =
number. People will still be able to find the old ones through Google, =
and we can configure the old JIRA to send emails to our mailing list =
here if that=92s a concern. To me the most important thing is to =
finalize our infrastructure so that we avoid confusing developers and =
users, and the sooner we do this the better, as it will get more and =
more disruptive over time.

+1 for the report, thanks Matei. Will sign off if by EOD if no more comment=
s.

As for JIRA import, yeah the worst case we could just skip the import
and do manual "import" for some important issues from amplab JIRA.
That what we did in MetaModel podling. Kinda hassle but at the end the
migration done and can focus on ASF jira instead.

Hi,

I am not noticing any DSGD implementation of ALS in Spark.

There are two ALS implementations.

org.apache.spark.examples.SparkALS does not run on large matrices and seems
more like a demo code.

org.apache.spark.mllib.recommendation.ALS looks feels more robust version
and I am experimenting with it.

References here are Jellyfish, Twitter's implementation of Jellyfish called
Scalafish, Google paper called Sparkler and similar idea put forward by IBM
paper by Gemulla et al. (large-scale matrix factorization with distributed
stochastic gradient descent)

https://github.com/azymnis/scalafish

Are there any plans of adding DSGD in Spark or there are any existing JIRA ?

Thanks.
Deb

Hi Deb,

Thanks for your email.  We currently do not have a DSGD implementation in
MLlib. Also, just to clarify, DSGD is not a variant of ALS, but rather a
different algorithm for solving the same the same bi-convex objective
function.

It would be a good thing to do add, but to the best of my knowledge, no one
is actively working on this right now.

Also, as you mentioned, the ALS implementation in mllib is more
robust/scalable than the one in spark.examples.

-Ameet

Hi,
I used the following command to compile against hadoop 2.2:
mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pnew-yarn

But I got a lot of compilation errors.

Did I use the wrong command ?

I think you also need to set yarn.version

Say something like=20

mvn -Pyarn -Dhadoop.version=3D2.2.0 -Dyarn.version=3D2.2.0 -DskipTests clea=
n package


hadoop.version is default to 2.2.0 while yarn.version not when you chose th=
e new-yarn profile. We probably need to fix it later for easy usage.

same?

Worker is used more frequently in the codebase:

aash@aash-mbp ~/git/spark$ git grep -i worker | wc -l
     981
aash@aash-mbp ~/git/spark$ git grep -i slave | wc -l
     348
aash@aash-mbp ~/git/spark$

Does it make sense to unify on one or the other?

It is historic.

I think we are converging towards

worker: the "slave" daemon in the standalone cluster manager

executor: the jvm process that is launched by the worker that executes tasks

Ya we've been trying to standardize on the terminology here (see glossary):

http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html

I think "slave" actually isn't mentioned here at all - but references
to slave in the codebase are synonymous with "worker".

That matches my mental model -- glad to hear we're converging on one though
for consistency.

Thanks guys!

dev,

I would be interesting in understanding how to make core Spark run on a non
IP network stack like MPI. The main dependencies seem to be
in org.apache.spark.network but I also see some other dependencies
sprinkled in auxiliary functions.

Pointers to code, mailing list discussions or people to talk to appreciated.

Take care,

  Kai

I think yarn.version should be specified in pom.xml along with
hadoop.version

Cheers

Hi Ameet,

Matrix factorization is a non-convex problem and ALS solves it using 2
convex problems, DSGD solves the problem by finding a local minima.

I am experimenting with Spark Parallel ALS but I intend to port Scalafish
https://github.com/azymnis/scalafish to Spark as well.

For bigger matrices jury is not out that which algorithms provides a better
local optima with an iteration bound. It is also highly dependent on
datasets I believe.

Thanks.
Deb

ALS and SGD solve the same non-convex objective function, and thus both
yield local minima.  The following reference provides a nice overview (in
particular see equation 2 of this paper):

There are two main uses of network in Spark (ignoring Spark Streaming)
through
1. spark.network stuff for bulk data transfer
2. Akka <http://akka.io/> actor library for control plane messaging

Besides porting the spark.network, you will also have to port Akka to run
on your stack. You will find most of the control layer class like
DAGScheduler, BlockManager, etc uses actor to communicate as well as to
process events in a single-threaded fashion. For example, the
BlockManagerMaster (driver) and the BlockManager (worker) communicate
(control messages only) using the BlockManagerMasterActor and
BlockManagerSlaveActor, respectively.

A good place to start would be to first read up on Akka from online
docs<http://akka.io/docs/> and
look at the code to see how we use it.

Subject: Changes that affect packaging and running Spark

Hey All,

Today we merged a pull request which changes the organization of the
scripts use to run Spark. The change is fairly minor but it will
affect anyone who packages spark or uses spark's binary scripts.
Spark's scripts are now divided into a /bin and /sbin directories.
This will be the layout in Spark 0.9.

/bin contains user-facing scripts:
/bin/spark-shell
/bin/pyspark
/bin/spark-class
/bin/run-example

/sbin contains administrative scripts for launching the standalone
cluster manager:
/bin/start-master.sh
/bin/start-all.sh
...etc

This allows administrators to set permissions differently for user and
admin scripts. It is also consistent with the way many other projects
package binaries. This change was contributed by @xiajunluan,
@shane-huang, and @ScrapCodes.

https://github.com/apache/incubator-spark/pull/317

Cheers,
- Patrick

Hi,
There're two copies of classes w.r.t. YARN:

-rw-r--r--  1 tyu  staff  9710 Jan  3 10:14
/Users/tyu/spark//yarn/alpha/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/WorkerLauncher.scala
-rw-r--r--  1 tyu  staff  8189 Jan  3 10:14
/Users/tyu/spark//yarn/stable/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/WorkerLauncher.scala

The class under yarn/stable is for YARN 2.2, right ?

Cheers

, at line 86:

    // Workaround until hadoop moves to something which has
    // https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8406 - fixed in
(2.0.2-alpha but no 0.23 line)
    //
org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.CompressionCodecFactory.getCodecClasses(conf)

Looks like the above comment can be removed since hadoop 2.2 has HADOOP-8406

Cheers

Hey All,

Due to an ASF requirement, we recently merged a patch which removes
the sbt jar from the build. This is necessary because we aren't
allowed to distributed binary artifacts with our source packages.

This means that instead of building Spark with "sbt/sbt XXX", you'll
need to have sbt yourself and just run "sbt XXX" from within the Spark
directory. This is similar to the maven build, where we expect users
already have maven installed.

You can download sbt at http://www.scala-sbt.org/. It's okay to just
download the most recent version of sbt, since sbt knows how to fetch
other versions of itself and will always use the one we specify in our
build file to compile spark.

- Patrick

Could we ship a shell script which downloads the sbt jar if not present
(like for example https://github.com/holdenk/slashem/blob/master/sbt )?

We thought about this but elected not to do this for a few reasons.

1. Some people build from machines that do not have internet access
for security reasons and retrieve dependency from internal nexus
repositories. So having a build dependency that relies on internet
downloads is not desirable.

2. It's a hard to ensure stability of a particular URL in perpetuity.
This is why maven central and other mirror networks exist. Keep in
mind that we can't change the release code ever once we release it,
and if something changed about the particular URL it could break the
build.

That makes sense, I think we could structure a script in such a way that it
would overcome these problems though and probably provide a fair a mount of
benefit for people who just want to get started quickly.

The easiest would be to have it use the system sbt if present and then fall
back to downloading the sbt jar. As far as stability of the URL goes we
could solve this by either having it point at a domain we control, or just
with an clear error message indicating it failed to download sbt and the
user needs to install sbt.

If a restructured script in that manner would be useful I could whip up a
pull request :)

I'm in full agreement with Holden. We should provide a smooth out of the
box experience while also not getting in the way of those who provide their
own sbt installs.

Hey Holden,

That sounds reasonable to me. Where would we get a url we can control
though? Right now the project has web space is at incubator.apache...

Sound reasonable.  But I think few installed sbt even it is easy to install.=
  I think can provide this tricky script in online document, user could down=
load this script to install sbt independence. Sound like a yet another brew i=
nstall sbt?

Reynold the issue is releases are immutable and we expect them to be
downloaded for several years after the release date.

Patrick, that is right. All we are trying to ensure is to make a
"best-effort" attempt to make it smooth for a new user. The script will try
its best to automatically install / download sbt for the user. The fallback
will be that the user will have to install sbt on their own. If the URL
happens to change and our script fails to automatically download, then we
are *no worse* than not providing the script at all.

So I've put together a pull request which depends on the typesafe URLs

You don't need gcc to build Spark, and there is very little difference
between developing and running Spark and Shark on OSX vs. Linux.  In fact,
I dare say that most of the Spark committers develop primarily on MBPs and
run it at different times on their local OSX machine and on physical or
virtual Linux machines.

Why is it not possible? You always update the script; just can't update
scripts for released versions.

Some do work with Spark as much as possible within IntelliJ or Eclipse (or
Sublime), but I'm not one of them.  I work closer to your second option,
with some Emacs and deployment tooling also thrown into the mix.  In short,
you need to find someone else to answer questions about how to most fully
use an IDE to develop Spark and/or Spark applications.

Hi Spark-ers,

I implemented a SGD version of multinomial logistic regression based on
mllib's optimization package. If this classifier is in the future plan of
mllib, I will be happy to contribute my code.

Cheers

Hi Michael,

What strategy are you using to train the multinomial classifier? One-vs-all?=
 I've got an optimized version of that method that I've been meaning to clea=
n up and commit for a while. In particular, rather than shipping a (potentia=
lly very big) model with each map task, I ship it once before each iteration=
 with a broadcast variable. Perhaps we can compare versions and incorporate s=
ome of my optimizations into your code?

Thanks,
Evan

I actually have two versions:
one is based on gradient descent like the logistic regression on mllib.
the other is based on Newtown iteration, it is not as fast as SGD, but we
can get all the statistics from it like deviance, p-values and fisher info.

we can get confusion matrix in both versions

the gradient descent version is just a modification of logistic regression
with my own implementation. I did not use LabeledPoints class.

I am trying to exclude the hadoop jar dependencies from spark=92s =
assembly files, the reason being that in order to work on our cluster it =
is necessary to use our now version of those files instead of the =
published ones. I tried define the hadoop dependencies as =93provided=94, =
but surpassingly this causes compilation errors in the build. Just to be =
clear, I modified the sbt build file=20
as follows:

  def yarnEnabledSettings =3D Seq(
    libraryDependencies ++=3D Seq(
      // Exclude rule required for all ?
      "org.apache.hadoop" % "hadoop-client" % hadoopVersion  % =
"provided" excludeAll(excludeJackson, excludeNetty, excludeAsm, =
excludeCglib),
      "org.apache.hadoop" % "hadoop-yarn-api" % hadoopVersion  % =
"provided" excludeAll(excludeJackson, excludeNetty, excludeAsm, =
excludeCglib),
      "org.apache.hadoop" % "hadoop-yarn-common" % hadoopVersion  % =
"provided" excludeAll(excludeJackson, excludeNetty, excludeAsm, =
excludeCglib),
      "org.apache.hadoop" % "hadoop-yarn-client" % hadoopVersion  % =
"provided" excludeAll(excludeJackson, excludeNetty, excludeAsm, =
excludeCglib)
    )
  )

and compile as=20

 SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=3D2.2.0 SPARK_YARN=3Dtrue SPARK_IS_NEW_HADOOP=3Dtrue=
 sbt  assembly


but the assembly still includes the hadoop libraries, contrary to what =
the assembly docs say. I managed to exclude them instead by using the =
non-recommended way:
def extraAssemblySettings() =3D Seq(
    test in assembly :=3D {},
    mergeStrategy in assembly :=3D {
      case m if m.toLowerCase.endsWith("manifest.mf") =3D> =
MergeStrategy.discard
      case m if m.toLowerCase.matches("meta-inf.*\\.sf$") =3D> =
MergeStrategy.discard
      case "log4j.properties" =3D> MergeStrategy.discard
      case m if m.toLowerCase.startsWith("meta-inf/services/") =3D> =
MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines
      case "reference.conf" =3D> MergeStrategy.concat
      case _ =3D> MergeStrategy.first
    },
    excludedJars in assembly <<=3D (fullClasspath in assembly) map { cp =
=3D>=20
     cp filter {_.data.getName.contains("hadoop")}
    }
)


But I would like to hear whether there is interest in excluding the =
hadoop jar by default in the build

Alex,

I don't know if it helps or not but sometimes back I made maven assembly to be
able to package Spark in Bigtop. That assembly exclude all hadoop
dependencies. So, you can simply build it using maven, instead of sbt.

Regards,
  Cos

Hi Michael,

This sounds great. Would you please send these as a pull request.
Especially if you can make your Newtown method implementation generic such
that it can later be used by other algorithms, it would be very helpful.
For example, you could add it as another optimization method under
mllib/optimization.

Was there a particular reason you chose not use LabeledPoint?

We have some instructions for contributions here: <
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Contributing+to+Spark>

Thanks,

--Hossein

Hi Hossein,

I can still use LabeledPoint with little modification. Currently I convert
the category into {0, 1} sequence, but I can do the conversion in the body
of methods or functions.

In order to make the code run faster, I try not to use DoubleMatrix
abstraction to avoid memory allocation; another reason is that jblas has no
data structure to handle symmetric matrix addition efficiently.

My code is not very pretty because I handle matrix operations manually (by
indexing).

If you think it is ok, I will make a pull request.

Hi all
         Spark job web ui will not be available when job is over, but it is=
 convenient for developer to debug with persisting job web ui. I just come =
up with draft for this issue.

1.       We could simply save the web page with html/xml format(stages/exec=
utors/storages/environment) to certain location when job finished

2.       But it is not easy for user to review the job info with #1, we cou=
ld build extra job history service for developers

3.       But where will we build this history service? In Driver node or Ma=
ster node?

Any suggestions about this improvement?

regards,

Thanks.
Broadcasting such huge entities does not seem like a feasible solution.
Serialization-Deserialization and network seem to have a huge overhead for
large files.

Before I consider moving into an external lookup service (as Christopher
rightly suggested) I was wondering if I could make each slave load the
large file in memory and do lookup operations in parallel.

*I am struck at how to make each slave load the files just once and perform
the lookup service.*

I tried using a hack where I check if the object is not initialised, I
shall initialise it. The problem is now for multiple threads running on a
single slave, I need a global object (specific to the JVM on that slave) to
hold on the other threads using "synchronized" while one of them is loading
the large file for me.
Any suggestions what can that unique object specific to that particular JVM
be. Is SparkContext an option ?

As a sidenote, it would be nice to make sure that whatever done here will
work with the YARN Application History Server (YARN-321), a generic history
server that functions similarly to MapReduce's JobHistoryServer.  It will
eventually have the ability to store application-specific data.

Hey Sandy,

Do you know what the status is for YARN-321 and what version of YARN
it's targeted for? Also, is there any kind of documentation or API for
this? Does it control the presentation of the data itself (e.g. it
actually has its own UI)?

@Tom - having an optional history server sounds like a good idea.

One question is what format to use for storing the data and how the
persisted format relates to XML/HTML generation in the live UI. One
idea would be to add JSON as an intermediate format inside of the
current WebUI, and then any JSON page could be persisted and rendered
by the history server using the same code. Once a SparkContext exits
it could dump a series of named paths each with a JSON file. Then the
history server could load those paths and pass them through the second
rendering stage (JSON => XML) to create each page.

It would be good if SPARK-969 had a good design doc before anyone
starts working on it.

- Patrick

Purav, look up the Singleton pattern which is what you seem to be
describing.

The strategy you describe does not sound like a good idea, however. It
couples the "lookup" service rather strongly (and serially) to its data
processing clients. This is usually, though not always, less robust and
efficient.

Sent while mobile. Pls excuse typos etc.

Hey,

YARN-321 is targeted for the Hadoop 2.4.  The minimum feature set doesn't
include application-specific data, so that probably won't be part of 2.4
unless other things delay the release for a while.  There are no APIs for
it yet and pluggable UIs have been discussed but not agreed upon.  I think
requirements from Spark could be useful in helping shape what gets done
there.

-Sandy

Hi,

I've read the spark code style guide for contributors here:

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Spark+Code+Style+Guide

For scala code, do you have a scalariform configuration that you use to 
format your code to these specs?

Cheers,

Michael

Not that I know of. This would be very useful to add, especially if we =
can make SBT automatically check the code style (or we can somehow plug =
this into Jenkins).

We have a Scala style configuration file in Shark:
https://github.com/amplab/shark/blob/master/scalastyle-config.xml

However, the scalastyle project is still pretty primitive and doesn't cover
most of the use cases. It is still great to include it to cover basic
checks such as 100-char wide lines.

We use sbt-scalariform in our company, and it can automatically format
the coding style when runs `sbt compile`.

https://github.com/sbt/sbt-scalariform

We ask our developers to run `sbt compile` before commit, and it's
really nice to see everyone has the same spacing and indentation.

Thanks for doing that, DB. Not sure about others, but I'm actually strongly
against blanket automatic code formatters, given that they can be
disruptive. Often humans would intentionally choose to style things in a
certain way for more clear semantics and better readability. Code
formatters don't capture these nuances. It is pretty dangerous to just auto
format everything.

Maybe it'd be ok if we restrict the code formatters to a very limited set
of things, such as indenting function parameters, etc.

I'm also very wary of using a code formatter for the reasons already
mentioned by Reynold.

Does scaliform have a mode where it just provides style checks rather
than reformat the code? This is something we really need for, e.g.,
reviewing the many submissions to the project.

Initially, we also had the same concern, so we started from limited
set of rules. Gradually, we found that it increases the productivity
and readability of our codebase.

PS, Scalariform is compatible with the Scala Style Guide in the sense
that, given the right preference settings, source code that is
initially compiliant with the Style Guide will not become uncompliant
after formatting. In a number of cases, running the formatter will
make uncompliant source more compliant.

I added the configuration option in the latest PR to limit the set of
rules. The options are https://github.com/mdr/scalariform

When developers wants to choose their own style for whatever reasons,
they can source directives to turn it off by `// format: OFF`.

Just quickly run the formatter, and I found that Spark is in general
in good shape; most of the changes are extra space after semicolon.

I am just starting out playing with spark on our hadoop 2.2 cluster and =
I have a question.

The current way to submit jobs to the cluster is to create fat-jars with =
sbt assembly. This approach works but I think is less than optimal in =
many large hadoop installation:

the way we interact with the cluster is to log into a CLI machine, which =
is the only authorized to submit jobs. Now, I can not use the CLI =
machine as a dev environment since for security reason the CLI and =
hadoop cluster is fire-walled and can not reach out to the internet, so =
sbt and manven resolution does not work.

So the procedure now is:
- hack code
- sbt assembly
- rsync my spark directory to the CLI machine
- run my job.

the issue is that every time i need to shuttle large binary files (all =
the fat-jars) back and forth, they are about 120Mb now, which is slow, =
particularly when I am working remotely from home.

I was wondering whether a better solution would be to create normal =
thin-jars of my code, which is very small, less than a Mb, and have no =
problem to copy every time to the cluster, but to take advantage of the =
sbt-create directory lib_managed to handle dependencies. We already have =
this directory that sbt handles with all the needed dependencies for the =
job to run. Wouldn=92t be possible to have the Spark Yarn Client take =
care of adding all the jars in lib_managed to class path and distribute =
them to the workers automatically (and they could also be cached across =
invocations of spark, after all those jars are versioned and immutable, =
with the possible exception of -SNAPSHOT releases). I think that this =
would greatly simplify the development procedure and remove the need of =
messing with ADD_JAR and SPARK_CLASSPATH.

What do you think?

I think you could put the spark jar and other jar your app depends on while=
 not changes a lot on HDFS, and use --files or --addjars ( depends on the m=
ode you run YarnClient/YarnStandalone ) to refer to them.
And then just need to redeploy your thin app jar on each invoke.

Raymond Liu

Hi All,

We would like to contribute SimRank algorithm to mllib. SimRank algorithm u=
sed to calculate similarity rank between two objects based on graph structu=
re, details can be seen in (http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/508/1/2001-41.p=
df), here we implemented a matrix multiplication method based on basic algo=
rithm, the description of matrix multiplication method can be seen in (http=
://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/files/wwwj.pdf) chapter 4.1.

The implementation is abstracted and generalized from our customer's real c=
ase, we made some tradeoffs to improve the speed and reduce the shuffle siz=
e. we just wondered if this algorithm be suitable to put into mllib? What e=
lse should we take care about?

Any suggestion would be really appreciated.

Thanks
Jerry

+1 for JSON.  The job server could also save context history and state and
make it queryable via REST APIs regardless of YARN / Mesos / standalone.

Hi Jerry,

Why don't you submit a pull request and then we can discuss there? If
SimRank is not common enough, we might take the matrix multiplication
method in and merge that. At the very least, even if SimRank doesn't get
merged into Spark, we can include a contrib package or a Wiki page that
links to examples of various algorithms community members have implemented.

well, yes, you can, but it would be much more convenient if spark were to
automatically take care of all the jars under lib_managed, rather than
having to list 20-30 jar in --files and --addJars

 IMHO from a pure Spark standpoint, I don't know if having a dedicated
history service makes sense as of now - considering that cluster managers
have their own history servers. Just showing UI of history runs might be
too thin a requirement for a full service. Spark should store history
information that can later be exposed in required ways.

Since each SparkContext is the logical entry and exit point for doing
something useful in Spark, during its stop(), it should serialize that
run's statistics into a JSON file - like "sc_run_[name]_[start-time].json".
When SparkUI.stop() is called, it in turn asks its UI objects (which should
implement a trait) to provide either a flat or hierarchical Map of String
key/value pairs. This map (flat, hierarchical) is then serialized to a
configured path (default being "var/history").

With regards to Mesos or YARN, their applications during shutdown can have
API to import this Spark history into their history servers - by making API
calls etc.

This way Spark's history information is persisted independent of cluster
framework, and cluster frameworks can import the history when/as needed.
Hope this helps.
Regards,
pillis

The listeners in SparkUI which update the counters can trigger saves along
the way.
The save can be on a 500ms delay after the last update, to batch changes.
This solution would not require save on stop().

Pillis - I agree we need to decouple the representation from a
particular history server. But why not provide as simple history
server people can (optionally) run if they aren't using Yarn or Mesos?
For people running the standalone cluster scheduler this seems
important. Giving them only a JSON dump isn't super consumable for
most users.

One more thing that would be good to have is a set of command line
tools to parse the JSON dump. I think something like a python wrapper
script that given a (job-id, stage-id) can parse the JSON and print
out the stage / task timings, with histograms etc. From my own
perspective, It'll be super useful for generating data that can be
used in benchmarks and experiment results etc.

Thanks

My primary concern was having too many watches for history.
But I do not have an argument against stand-alone mode.

Also questions about automatic lifecycle management of history server -
when to start / stop etc. in a cluster environment would be difficult when
one is not the cluster manager.

I agree that JSON files are not easily readable.
Maybe a stand-alone history server which makes it implicit that it is only
for that host would be fine.

Hi, All =20

Is there any plan to develop an application level fair scheduler=3F

I think it will have more value than a fair scheduler within the applicat=
ion (actually I didn=E2=80=99t understand why we want to fairly share the=
 resource among jobs within the application, in usual, users submit diffe=
rent applications, not jobs)=E2=80=A6

This is true for now, we didn=92t want to replicate those systems. But =
it may change if we see demand for fair scheduling in our standalone =
cluster manager.

Hi Guys,

I did some changes in JavaNetworkWordCount for my researches in streaming p=
rocess and I have added to the code the following lines in red:

ssc1.checkpoint("hdfs://computer22:54310/user/root/INPUT");
 JavaDStream<String> lines1 =3D ssc1.socketTextStream("localhost", Integer.=
parseInt("12345"));
 JavaDStream<String> lines2 =3D ssc1.socketTextStream("localhost", Integer.=
parseInt("12345"));
 JavaDStream<String> union2 =3D lines1.union(lines2);
     JavaDStream<String> words =3D union2.flatMap(new FlatMapFunction<Strin=
g, String>() {
     @Override
       public Iterable<String> call(String x) {
          return Lists.newArrayList(SPACE.split(x));
        }
     });
     JavaPairDStream<String, Integer> wordCounts =3D words.map(
new PairFunction<String, String, Integer>() {
          @Override
          public Tuple2<String, Integer> call(String s) {
           return new Tuple2<String, Integer>(s, 1);
         }
        }).reduceByKey(new Function2<Integer, Integer, Integer>() {
          @Override
         public Integer call(Integer i1, Integer i2) {
           return i1 + i2;
          }
        });
 =20
      JavaPairDStream<String, Integer> counts =3D wordCounts.reduceByKeyAnd=
Window(
        new Function2<Integer, Integer, Integer>() {
          public Integer call(Integer i1, Integer i2) { return i1 + i2; }
        },
        new Function2<Integer, Integer, Integer>() {
          public Integer call(Integer i1, Integer i2) { return i1 - i2; }
        },
        new Duration(60 * 5 * 1000),
     new Duration(1 * 1000)
        =20
	 counts.print();
   ssc1.start();
=20
   }
 }


- We did a code in C that send words to workers.

- Result From Master terminal:

My question is, where does it happening the union()? between in the nodes o=
r in the master?  I am using three machines( 1 Master + 2 Nodes).
How could I get a total count of the words and show in the terminal?

Thanks all =20

Hey,


We are excited that AMP Camp 4 is less than a month away!


AMP Camp 4 will be a compact one-day version of AMP Camp, consisting of two
tutorials at 2014 Strata Conference <http://strataconf.com/strata2014> in
Santa Clara. Those tutorials will be run by PhD students and faculty from
the UC Berkeley AMPLab and contain
talks<http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/32374>and
hands-on
exercises <http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/32386>ab=
out
the newest components of the Berkeley
Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) <https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software> that
they are actively developing.

The first part<http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/3237=
4>of
the two-part series will kick off with talks on Spark, Spark Streaming
and Shark. We will then highlight three new components of the Berkeley Data
Analytics Stack (BDAS). We=E2=80=99ll start with BlinkDB, an approximate qu=
ery
engine for running interactive SQL queries on large volumes of data. Second
up will be MLBase, a platform for implementing and consuming machine
learning algorithms at scale. Then Tachyon, a fault tolerant distributed
in-memory file system.

Later in the day we will host hands-on
training<http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/32386>cove=
ring
basic Spark, Shark and these new BDAS components. Each member of
the training will be provided with access to their own EC2 cluster
pre-loaded with datasets that they can use to run exercises utilizing these
new technologies.

To sign up for AMP Camp 4,
register<https://en.oreilly.com/strata2014/public/register>with the
Strata Conference and be sure to select the tutorials day. The
folks at O=E2=80=99Reilly have been gracious enough to offer a 20% discount=
 to the
friends of the AMPLab.

Use the code AMP20 when registering to get 20% off your ticket price.

Lastly, we have a free 3-day conference pass to give out! If you can take a
minute to fill out this short
form<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y6rmzU_i_PbuV17mHauwqQyIvdBX-8g8opKSH=
yrvs0A/viewform>(your
emails will not be used for marketing purposes), you will be entered
in a drawing to win a 3-day Strata Santa Clara pass. The winner will be
able to join us for AMP Camp 4 and the following 2 days of Strata.

You can access the web form at: ampcamp.berkeley.edu/2014StrataPass

We are excited to share what we have been working on with you. Hope to see
you there!

All the best,
Scott

Subject: The performance of group operation on SSD
From: Chen Jin <karen.cj@gmail.com>
To: dev@spark.incubator.apache.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Dear Spark developers:

We are benchmarking spark operations such as filter, group, join on
ssd instance i2.2xlarge on EC2. Most operations are similar or
slightly better than ephemeral disks on EC2, however, the performance
of group operation on SDD  are much worse than regular disks, at least
2x to 3x worse. Could any of you shed some lights on this behavior?

Thanks a lot,

-chen

All the computation with the data (that is, union, flatmap, map,
reduceByKey, reduceByKeyAndWindow) are executed on the workers in a
distributed manner. The data is received by the worker nodes and kept in
memory, then the computation is executed on the workers to the in-memory
data.

After the count is computed for every batch of data, the first 10 elements
of the generated counts are brought to master for being printed on the
screen. This is done by the counts.print() which pulls those 10 word-count
pairs and prints them.

On a related note, if you only want to counts over a window, you dont need
the first reduceByKey. The reduceByKeyAndWindow takes care of doing the
reduceByKey per batch and then doing the reduce across a window.

Just testing out the rc1. I create a dependent project (using maven) and =
I copied the HdfsTest.scala test, but I added a single line to save the =
file back to disk:

package org.apache.spark.examples

import org.apache.spark._

object HdfsTest {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val sc =3D new SparkContext(args(0), "HdfsTest",
      System.getenv("SPARK_HOME"), =
SparkContext.jarOfClass(this.getClass))
    val file =3D sc.textFile(args(1))
    val mapped =3D file.map(s =3D> s.length).cache()
    for (iter <- 1 to 10) {
      val start =3D System.currentTimeMillis()
      for (x <- mapped) { x + 2 }
      //  println("Processing: " + x)
      val end =3D System.currentTimeMillis()
      println("Iteration " + iter + " took " + (end-start) + " ms")
      mapped.saveAsTextFile("out")
    }
    System.exit(0)
  }
}

and this my pom file:

Hello,
I wanted to write down at a high level the changes I was thinking of.
Please feel free to critique and suggest changes.

SparkContext:
SparkContext start will not be starting UI anymore. Rather it will launch a
SparkContextObserver (has SparkListener trait) which will generate a
SparkContextData instance. SparkContextObserver keeps SparkContextData
uptodate. SparkContextData will have all the historical information anyone
needs. Stopping a SparkContext stops the SparkContextObserver.

SparkContextData:
Has all historical information of a SparkContext run. Periodically persists
itself to disk as JSON. Can hydrate itself from the same JSON.
SparkContextDatas are created without any UI usage. SparkContextData can
evolve independently of what UI needs - like having non-UI data needed for
third party integration.

SparkUI:
No longer needs SparkContext. Will need an array of SparkContextDatas
(either by polling folder or other means). UI pages at render time will
access appropriate SparkContextData and produce HTML. SparkUI can be
started and stopped independently of SparkContexts. Multiple SparkContexts
can be shown in UI.

I have purposefully not gone into much detail. Please let me know if any
piece needs to be elaborated.
Regards,
Pillis

Hi Pillis

It sound goods
1. For SparkContextData, I think we could persist in HDFS not in local disk=
(one SparkUI service may show more than one sparkcontext)
2. we also could consider SparkContextData as one metrics input(MetricsSour=
ce), for long running spark job, SparkContextData will shown in ganglia/jmx=
 .....
3. if we persist SparkContextData periodically, we need to rewrite the UI l=
ogic as spark ui now just show one timestamp information.

Subject: Re: About Spark job web ui persist(JIRA-969)

Hello,
I wanted to write down at a high level the changes I was thinking of.
Please feel free to critique and suggest changes.

SparkContext:
SparkContext start will not be starting UI anymore. Rather it will launch a=
 SparkContextObserver (has SparkListener trait) which will generate a Spark=
ContextData instance. SparkContextObserver keeps SparkContextData uptodate.=
 SparkContextData will have all the historical information anyone needs. St=
opping a SparkContext stops the SparkContextObserver.

SparkContextData:
Has all historical information of a SparkContext run. Periodically persists=
 itself to disk as JSON. Can hydrate itself from the same JSON.
SparkContextDatas are created without any UI usage. SparkContextData can ev=
olve independently of what UI needs - like having non-UI data needed for th=
ird party integration.

SparkUI:
No longer needs SparkContext. Will need an array of SparkContextDatas (eith=
er by polling folder or other means). UI pages at render time will access a=
ppropriate SparkContextData and produce HTML. SparkUI can be started and st=
opped independently of SparkContexts. Multiple SparkContexts can be shown i=
n UI.

I have purposefully not gone into much detail. Please let me know if any pi=
ece needs to be elaborated.
Regards,
Pillis

Hi Junluan,
1. Yes, we could persist to HDFS or any FS. I think at a minimum we should
persist it to local disk - keeps the core simple.
We can think of HDFS interactions as level-2 functionality that can be
implemented once we have a good local implementation. The
persistence/hydration layer of a SparkContextData can be made pluggable as
a next step.
Also, as mentioned in previous mail, SparkUI will now show multiple
SparkContexts using data from SparkContextDatas.

2. Yes, we could

3. Yes, SparkUI will need a rewrite to deal with SparkContextDatas (either
live, or hydrated from historical JSONs).
Regards

Patrick

Subject: GC tuning for Spark

Hi all,

I'm finding that Java GC can be a major performance bottleneck when running
Spark at high (>50% or so) memory utilization.  What GC tuning have people
tried for Spark and how effective has it been?

Thanks!

Kay

Hi Eduardo,

If the streaming data is sent to Worker X, then the data is stored in the
memory of Worker X and another worker Y. if replication is disabled through
the StorageLevel in the input stream, then only worker X. That is why you
could be seeing one the machines have a high memory usage. The data is
essentially stored as RDDs within the memory of the Spark's worker
processes and by default, the used data is thrown out using Spark's default
LRU method. If you want to reduce the memory consumption within Spark's
storage memory, then there are two options.
1. You can set the Java property "spark.cleaner.ttl" appropriately (see Spa=
rk
configuration<http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.h=
tml>).
This forces all data persisted in memory to be cleaned up. But this needs
to be set conservative so that you dont accidentally clear up data that
havent been process yet.
2. In the latest code of Spark Streaming (master branch of the Spark
repo<https://github.com/apache/incubator-spark/>),
if you set the property spark.streaming.unpersist, then the Spark Streaming
will automatically throw away data that is not needed any more.

Hopefully this clarifies the doubts. Feel free to ask more questions.

TD

There are a bunch of tricks noted in the Tuning
Guide<http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/tuning.html#memory-tuning>.
You may have seen them already but I thought its still worth mentioning for
the records.

Besides those, if you are concerned about consistent latency (that is, low
variability in the job processing times), then using
concurrent-mark-and-sweep GC is recommended. Instead of big stop-the-world
GC pauses, there are many smaller pauses. This reduction in variability
comes at the cost of processing throughput though, so thats a tradeoff.

And, of course, there are the bigger-hammer-than-GC-tuning approaches using
some combination of unchecked, off-heap and Tachyon.

I think incorporating https://github.com/amplab/tachyon/wiki is a better
solution. I remembered Matei has said that it was in his plan but not sure
about the ETA for it to happen.

Hi Patrick,
thank you for testing. I think I found out what is wrong: I am trying to =
build my own examples that also depend on another library which in turns =
depends on hadoop 2.2.
what was happening is that my library brings in hadoop 2.2, while spark =
depends on hadoop 1.04 and then I think I get conflict versions of the =
classes.=20

A couple of things are not clear to me:

1: do the published artifacts support YARN and hadoop 2.2 or will I need =
to make my own build?=20
2: if they do, how do I activate the profiles in my maven config? I =
tried mvn -Pyarn compile but it does not work (maven says =93[WARNING] =
The requested profile "yarn" could not be activated because it does not =
exist.=94)


essentially I would like to specify the spark dependencies as:

<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.scala-lang</groupId>
			<artifactId>scala-library</artifactId>
			<version>${scala.version}</version>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
			=
<artifactId>spark-core_${scala.tools.version}</artifactId>
			<version>0.9.0-incubating</version>
		</dependency>

and tell maven to use the =93yarn=94 profile for this dependency, but I =
do not seem to be able to make it work.=20
Anybody has any suggestion?

Alex=

Hey Alex,

Maven profiles only affect the Spark build itself. They do not
transitively affect your own build.

Checkout the docs for how to deploy applications on yarn:
http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-yarn.html

When compiling your application, just should explicitly add the hadoop
version you depend on to your own build (e.g. a hadoop-client
dependency). Take a look at the example here where we show adding
hadoop-client:

http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html

When deploying Spark applications on YARN, you actually want to mark
spark as a provided dependency in your application's maven and bundle
your application as an assembly jar, then submit it with a Spark YARN
bundle to a YARN cluster. The instructions are the same as they were
in 0.8.1.

For the spark jar you want to submit to YARN, you can download the
precompiled Spark one.

It might make sense to try this pipeline with 0.8.1 and get it working
there. It sounds here more like you are dealing with getting the build
set-up rather than a particular issue with the 0.9.0 RC.

- Patrick

Thanks for the help. I am doing progress, but I found I need to do a bit =
of fiddling with excluding dependencies from spark in order to have mine =
take effect. As soon as I have a working pom I will post here as an =
example.=20

I'm happy to announce the developer preview of SparkR, an R frontend
for Spark. SparkR presents Spark's API in R and allows you to write
code in R and run the computation on a Spark cluster. You can try out
SparkR today by installing it from our github repo at
https://github.com/amplab-extras/SparkR-pkg .

Right now SparkR is available as a standalone package that can be
installed to run on an existing Spark installation. Note that SparkR
requires Spark >= 0.9 and the default build uses the recent 0.9
release candidate. In the future we will consider merging this with
Apache Spark.

More details about SparkR and examples of SparkR code can be found at
http://amplab-extras.github.io/SparkR-pkg. I would like to thank
Zongheng Yang, Matei Zaharia and Matt Massie for their contributions
and help in developing SparkR.

Comments and pull requests are welcome on github.

Thanks
Shivaram

Hi pillis

Do you mind to submit more detail design document? May contain
1. what data structures will be exposed to external UI/metrics/third party
2. what new UI looks like if you want to persist SparkContextData periodica=
lly
3. .........

Any other suggestions?

Hi Tom,

So far you=92ve had to recompile with each release. Between master and =
0.8 in particular, one problem is that the Scala version changed, which =
will always require a recompile in Scala programs.

In the future, we want to make minor releases not require a recompile.

Matei

What file system do you have? One thing we=E2=80=99ve observed is that =
ext3, which is the default on ephemeral disks on EC2, scales very poorly =
to multicore workloads. We recommend reformatting those as XFS (which is =
very fast to format) or ext4 (which unfortunately takes a few hours to =
finalize). Maybe there are also other FS options that affect SSDs.

Also I should say with this that 1.0 will stay on Scala 2.10, and more =
generally I think we want to keep having releases for Scala 2.10 at =
least for this year. It should be easier to cross-build future releases =
for both 2.10 and 2.11 than it was with the 2.9 -> 2.10 jump.

What is the reason that standalone mode doesn't support the fair scheduler?
Does that mean that Mesos coarse mode also doesn't support the fair
scheduler?

BTW, we also run Scalariform, but we don't turn it on automatically.  We
find that for the most part it is good, but there are a few places where it
reformats things and doesn't look good, and requires cleanup.  I think
Scalariform requires some more rules to make it more generally useful.

It does.

There are two scheduling levels here.

The first level is what the cluster manager does. The standalone cluster
manager for Spark only supports FIFO at the moment at the level of
applications.

Regarding Spark itself. Within a single Spark application, both FIFO and
fair scheduling are supported, regardless of what your cluster manager is

Chen, I would also look at actual I/O patterns of the operations. SSDs
writes are sensitive to significantly variable performance depending on the
exact scenario, and can easily underperform HDD given the "right"
conditions. Generically quoted IOPS numbers are not reliable across a
variety of commonly occurring workloads.

Subject: Config properties broken in master
From: Mridul Muralidharan <mridul@gmail.com>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi,

  Unless I am mistaken, the change to using typesafe ConfigFactory has
broken some of the system properties we use in spark.

For example: if we have both
-Dspark.speculation=true -Dspark.speculation.multiplier=0.95
set, then the spark.speculation property is dropped.

The rules of parseProperty actually document this clearly [1]


I am not sure what the right fix here would be (other than replacing
use of config that is).

Any thoughts ?
I would vote -1 for 0.9 to be released before this is fixed.


Regards,
Mridul

I would vote -1 for this release until we resolve config property
issue [1] : if there is a known resolution for this (which I could not
find unfortunately, apologies if it exists !), then will change my
vote.

Thanks,
Mridul

change spark.speculation to spark.speculation.switch?

maybe we can restrict that all properties in Spark should be "three levels"

Hi,

  Speculation was an example, there are others in spark which are
affected by this ...
Some of them have been around for a while, so will break existing code/scripts.

Mridul

This is definitely an important issue to fix. Instead of renaming =
properties, one solution would be to replace Typesafe Config with just =
reading Java system properties, and disable config files for this =
release. I kind of like that over renaming.

I also just went over the config options to see how pervasive this is. In
addition to speculation, there is one more "conflict" of this kind:

spark.locality.wait
spark.locality.wait.node
spark.locality.wait.process
spark.locality.wait.rack


spark.speculation
spark.speculation.interval
spark.speculation.multiplier
spark.speculation.quantile

Really?  Disabling config files seems to me to be a bigger/more onerous
change for users than spark.speculation=true|false =>
spark.speculation.enabled=true|false and spark.locality.wait =>
spark.locality.wait.default.

We can add config files in a later release. They were never officially =
released, and were only in master for about a month.

One other thing to note is that the config file feature is kind of =
limited anyway. Users will want to have a separate config file with each =
app, which they have to ship with its classpath, and there=92s no great =
way of merging them in the current setup. I=92m not actually sure it=92s =
a feature we want to support, compared to say just a SparkConf.fromFile =
method that reads a Java Properties file.

Mridul, thanks a *lot* for pointing this out. This is indeed an issue

Since I was not around for a while, I am not sure how much config file

Hah!  Stupid English language -- by "fixed" I mean established/stabilized,
not repaired.

Subject: Should Spark on YARN example include --addJars?

Hey All,

I ran into an issue when trying to run SparkPi as described in the Spark on
YARN doc.

14/01/18 10:52:09 ERROR spark.SparkContext: Error adding jar
(java.io.FileNotFoundException:
spark-examples-assembly-0.9.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar (No such file or
directory)), was the --addJars option used?

Is addJars not needed here?

Here's the doc:

SPARK_JAR=./assembly/target/scala-2.9.3/spark-assembly-0.8.1-incubating-hadoop2.0.5-alpha.jar
\
    ./spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.Client \
      --jar examples/target/scala-2.9.3/spark-examples-assembly-0.8.1-incubating.jar
\
      --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
      --args yarn-standalone \
      --num-workers 3 \
      --master-memory 4g \
      --worker-memory 2g \
      --worker-cores 1


thanks,

Has anybody tested against YARN 2.2?  I tried it out against a
pseudo-distributed cluster and ran into an issue I just filed as

.

Sandy

mails are coming to be horribly delayed.


Thanks,

I've found a problem with the cartesian method on Pyspark and filed
as SPARK-1034
https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-1034

0.8.1 doesn't have this problem. On Scala, cartesian method works fine.

It's also nice if SPARK-978 can be fixed, too.
https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-978

Thanks,
Taka

This vote is cancelled in favor of rc3 - which fixes the YARN issue

@taka - thanks for reporting that bug. It's not enough to block this
release however. Once a fix exists we can merge it into the 0.9 branch
and it will be in 0.9.1

Eventually the notes get posted on the apache website. I attached them
to this e-mail so that people can get a sense of what is in the
release before they vote on it.

Subject: Re: About Spark job web ui persist(JIRA-969)

Hi Junluan,
I was thinking that the SparkContextData structure will mirror what the UI
needs, as it is a good use case.
It could look like this approximately
- SparkContextData
  - StagesData
    - SchedulingMode
    - Stages[]
  - StorageData
  - EnvironmentData
    - Map <category:String, Map<key:String, value:String>>
  - ExecutorsData
    - Executors[]

Metrics can show the data structure in JMX as is.

I was thinking the UI will look exactly the same as it does right now,
except that there will be a Combo-box on the title bar to pick the
SparkContext. Once picked, all the tabs and pages should look exactly the
same.
One additional information that will need to be shown is the SparkContext
state - running, stopped, etc.

Hope that helps.
Regards,
Pillis

Hi Eduardo,

You can do arbitrary stuff with the data in a DStream using the operation
foreachRDD.

yourDStream.foreachRDD(rdd =3D> {

   // Get and print first n elements
   val firstN =3D rdd.take(n)
   println("First N elements =3D " + firstN)

  // Count the number of elements in each batch
  println("RDD has " + rdd.count() + " elements")

})


Alternatively, just for printing the counts, you can also do

yourDStream.count.print()

Hope this helps!

TD

I can't get the tests to run on a Mac, 10.7.5, java -version output:

It looks like it's just a heap size issue. But since it's leaving a 
process running that has -Xmx3g explicitly specified on the command line 
I'm surprised it works for everyone else but consistently fails for me. 
Almost certainly not a blocker, but some memory setting in the tests 
might need adjustment.

It looks like it's just a heap size issue. But since it's leaving a 
process running that has -Xmx3g explicitly specified on the command line
 I'm surprised it works for everyone else but consistently fails for me.
 Almost certainly not a blocker, but some memory setting in the tests 
might need adjustment.<br>

That's a perm gen issue - you need to adjust the perm gem size. In sbt it
should've been set automatically, but I think for Maven, you need to set
the maven opts, which is documented in the build instructions.

I'm using sbt and also tried doubling all the values in the sbt/sbt 
script. Still fails during the tests, and leaves a sbt.ForkMain process 
running (and eating up 100% CPU...).

I can break this out into a separate issue/thread, I just figured it 
might be relevant since I'd imagine this is a fairly common setup 
(Macbook Air).

I can break this out into a separate issue/thread, I just figured it

It looks like it's just a heap size issue. But since it's leaving a 
process running that has -Xmx3g explicitly specified on the command line
 I'm surprised it works for everyone else but consistently fails for me.
 Almost certainly not a blocker, but some memory setting in the tests 
might need adjustment.<br>

I think we might need to change the subject to [RESULT][VOTE] or something
so that the apache scripts can tell when a vote thread ends, even if it's
simply being replaced by another vote thread for rc{n+1}.

This isn't a new RC or a result - I just tried to make an new vote
thread and the mail clients get confused and merge it in with the old

Would love to hear from Mridul to verify the fixes for problems he saw are

EC2 doesn't mount SSDs automatically, so I actually reformat those as
ex4, mount them and point hdfs to them. I haven't tweaked any FS
options and not sure what cause the problem. I will follow
Christopher's suggestion and see whether I can find any cause.

 Maybe there are also other FS options that affect SSDs.

Hi,

I think intermediate results are stored in spark.local.dir (/tmp by default), 
not in hdfs.

So if you see big latency in a shuffle-heavy operation, it's probably due to the 
device where /tmp reside. You can run iotop on your slaves to check where the 
operations are occuring. Check your wait% in top, to see if you have I/O problems

You can activate the consolidateFiles option if you use ext4, it helps when 
dealing with big intermediate results

Subject: a question about replicate() in BlockManager.scala
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

  var cachedPeers: Seq[BlockManagerId] = null
  private def replicate(blockId: String, data: ByteBuffer, level:
StorageLevel) {
    val tLevel = StorageLevel(level.useDisk, level.useMemory,
level.deserialized, 1)
    if (cachedPeers == null) {
      cachedPeers = master.getPeers(blockManagerId, level.replication - 1)
    }
    for (peer: BlockManagerId <- cachedPeers) {
      val start = System.nanoTime
      data.rewind()
      logDebug("Try to replicate BlockId " + blockId + " once; The size of
the data is "
        + data.limit() + " Bytes. To node: " + peer)
      if (!BlockManagerWorker.syncPutBlock(PutBlock(blockId, data, tLevel),
        new ConnectionManagerId(peer.host, peer.port))) {
        logError("Failed to call syncPutBlock to " + peer)
      }
      logDebug("Replicated BlockId " + blockId + " once used " +
        (System.nanoTime - start) / 1e6 + " s; The size of the data is " +
        data.limit() + " bytes.")
    }
	
	when the method called firstly, "cachedPeers == null" is true.
	Then "master.getPeers(blockManagerId, level.replication - 1)" execute and
we get peers that will be used to replicate blocks.
	But when the method called again, "cachedPeers == null" is false.
    "master.getPeers(blockManagerId, level.replication - 1)" will not
execute, and the peers that will be used to replicate blocks is same to the
peers we get firstly.
	Is it right?

Hey Tom,

Matei had to remove this because it turns out that there was a fairly
serious bug in the Typesafe config library we use for parsing conf
files [1]. There wasn't an immediate solution to this so he just
removed the capability for this release and we can revisit it in the
next release.

Btw - to be clear this was an incompatibility between Spark's config
names and constraints on names imposed by typesafe. So didn't mean to
imply there was something broken in their config library.

+1

However please fix a minor issue in documentation.

Please correct spark version in the "A Note About Hadoop Versions"  from
Spark (0.8.1) to Spark (0.9.0)

http://people.apache.org/~pwendell/spark-0.9.0-incubating-rc4-docs/

A minor suggestion:
Since Scala version is changed in this release, it would worth mentioned a
need of recompiling existing application to re-deploy on the new version.
This is obvious for experienced users, but many users may fail after first
upgrade.

Yup, that was it, though I believe people at Twitter picked it up again =
recently. I=92d suggest asking Dmitriy if you know him. I=92ve seen =
interest in this from several other groups, and if there=92s enough of =
it, maybe we can start another open source repo to track it. The work in =
that repo you pointed to was done over one week, and already had most of =
Pig=92s operators working. (I helped out with this prototype over =
Twitter=92s hack week.) That work also calls the Scala API directly, =
because it was done before we had a Java API; it should be easier with =
the Java one.

Just an IMHO.  We've moved a number of Pig jobs to Spark jobs, and the
benefits of a genuine conversion (type safety, terseness, debugging, lack
of gratuitous shells and shims around UDFs, ...) are sufficient that a
rewrite is probably preferable from an adapter unless you have an enormous
Pig investment that you want to continue investing in.

Yeah, this is true for new jobs, but some organizations have large =
libraries of Pig scripts and UDFs. I think what would be ideal is a =
Pig-to-Scala or Pig-to-Python binding layer similar to Shark=92s =
sql2rdd. That way you could run your existing Pig scripts, but also call =
them from Scala or Python to transition over to these programming =
languages.

Hi,

I am using spark streaming along with kafka dstream. and running the
application against standalone cluster

Spark version =3D> https://github.com/apache/incubator-spark/tree/branch-0.=
9

It seems  after transformation, when i o foreachRDD, its not working.

code snippet is below :
---------------------------------------------------------------
val ssc =3D new StreamingContext(...)
val stream =3D KafkaUtils.createStream(...)
val processedStream =3D stream.flatMap(...)
val newStream =3D processedStream.map(x =3D> (x, 1L)).reduceByKeyAndWindow(=
_ +
_, _ - _, Seconds(1), Seconds(1), 2)
newStream.foreachRDD(rdd =3D> {
      rdd.foreach({
        case (value, count) =3D> {
          println("##########################################")
          println("value --> " + value + " with count --> " + count)
          println("##########################################")
        }
      })
    })

---------------------------------------------------------------

If I run the application locally (local instead of spark://), it is working

Can you suggest what is going on here?

Hi,

Is there a debugger available for spark jobs. Something like what is
reported here : https://github.com/mesos/spark/wiki/Spark-Debugger

I need to understand how the RDDs have evolved and the delta changes in
them. Is there an existing API that helps me do this.

Thanks.

There's a pair of open pull requests that implement replay debugging for
newer versions of Spark:

https://github.com/apache/incubator-spark/pull/224
https://github.com/apache/incubator-spark/pull/284

Hi folks,

We=92ve been working on the transition to Apache for a while, and our =
last shepherd=92s report says the following:

--------------------
Spark

Alan Cabrera (acabrera):

  Seems like a nice active project.  IMO, there's no need to wait import
  to JIRA to graduate. Seems like they can graduate now.
--------------------

What do you think about graduating to a top-level project? As far as I =
can tell, we=92ve completed all the requirements for graduating:

- Made 2 releases (working on a third now)
- Added new committers and PPMC members (4 of them)
- Did IP clearance
- Moved infrastructure over to Apache, except for the JIRA above, which =
INFRA is working on and which shouldn=92t block us.

If everything is okay, I=92ll call a VOTE on graduating in 48 hours. The =
one final thing missing is that we=92ll need to nominate an initial VP =
for the project.

Matei=

What are the requirements and responsibilities of the VP?  (Or a link to
where they are laid out.)

+1 from me.

I'll throw Matei's name into the hat for VP. He's done a great job
and has stood out to me with his report filing and tenacity and
would make an excellent chair.

Being a chair entails:

1. being the eyes and ears of the board on the project.
2. filing a monthly (first 3 months, then quarterly) board report
similar to the incubator report.

Not too bad.

+1 for graduation from me binding when the VOTE comes. We need our
mentors and IPMC members to chime in and we should be in time for
February 2014 board meeting.

Cheers,
Chris

Today there was a bug reported almost simultaneously by Tom Graves and
Matt Massie that was enough to warrant a new RC. I'll post RC5

(which apparently helps automated scripts that consume the list) to
say it was cancelled.

Today there was a bug reported almost simultaneously by Tom Graves and
Matt Massie that was enough to warrant a new RC. I'll post RC5
momentarily and I'm also going to post a result thread for this one
(which apparently helps automated scripts that consume the list) to
say it was cancelled.

Hi all,

Is it possible to create a Spark Context (i.e. the driver program) from a s=
ervlet deployed on some application server ?
I am able to run spark Java driver successfully via maven / standalone (aft=
er specifying the classpath), but when I bundle spark libraries in a JAR, a=
long with my servlet (using maven shade plugin), it gives me security excep=
tion. Any suggestions?

Thanks and regards,

Kapil Malik

Subject: JavaRDD.collect()

Hi All,

I have some metadata saved as a single partition on HDFS (a few
hundred bytes) and when I want to get the content of the data:

JavaRDD blob =3D sc.textFile();
List<String> lines =3D blob.collect();

However, collect takes probably more than 3 seconds at least but
first() only take 0.1 second,

Could you advise on what's the best practice to read small files using spar=
k.

-chen

RDD.first() doesnt have to scan the whole partition. It gets only the first
item and returns it.
RDD.collect() has to scan the whole partition, collect all of it and send
all of it back (serialization + deserialization costs, etc.)

Hi Tathagata,

Thanks for the detailed explanation, I thought so too.However,
currently I only have one text partition which contains two lines.
Each line is like tens of characters in total. Why is there such a big
difference between first() and collect()? Instead 2x, I have around
30x difference.

The reason is likely because first() is entirely executed on the driver
node in the same process, while collect() needs to connect with worker
nodes.

Usually the first time you run an action, most of the JVM code are not
optimized, and the classloader also needs to load a lot of things on the
fly. Having to connect with other processes via RPC can slow the first
execution down in collect.

That said, if you run this a few times (in the same driver program) and it
is still much slower, you should look into other factors such as network
congestion, cpu/memory load on workers, etc.


BTW - this is a dev list for Spark development itself (not Spark
application development). Questions like this probably go better in the
user list in the future.

Hi all

The description about this Bug submitted by Matei is as following


The tipping point seems to be around 50. We should fix this by checkpointin=
g the RDDs every 10-20 iterations to break the lineage chain, but checkpoin=
ting currently requires HDFS installed, which not all users will have.

We might also be able to fix DAGScheduler to not be recursive.


regards,
Andrew

It seems to me fixing DAGScheduler to make it not recursive is the better
solution here, given the cost of checkpointing.

I'm an idiot, but which part of the DAGScheduler is recursive here? Seems
like processEvent shouldn't have inherently recursive properties.

In my test I found this phenomenon might be caused by RDD's long dependency=
 chain, this dependency chain is serialized into task and sent to each exec=
utor, while deserializing this task will cause stack overflow.

Especially in iterative job, like:
var rdd =3D ..

for (i <- 0 to 100)
 rdd =3D rdd.map(x=3D>x)

rdd =3D rdd.cache

Here rdd's dependency will be chained, at some point stack overflow will oc=
cur.

You can check (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/spark-=
users/dependency/spark-users/-Cyfe3G6VwY/PFFnslzWn6AJ) and (https://groups.=
google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/spark-users/dependency/spark-users/N=
kxcmmS-DbM/c9qvuShbHEUJ) for details. Current workaround method is to cut t=
he dependency chain by checkpointing RDD, maybe a better way is to clean th=
e dependency chain after materialize stage is executed.

Thanks
Jerry

I'm not entirely sure, but two candidates are

the visit function in stageDependsOn

submitStage

The three obvious ones in DAGScheduler.scala are in:

getParentStages
getMissingParentStages
stageDependsOn

They all follow the same pattern though (def visit(), followed by 
visit(root)), so they should be easy to replace with a Scala stack in 
place of the call stack.

I looked into this after I opened that JIRA and it=92s actually a bit =
harder to fix. While changing these visit() calls to use a stack =
manually instead of being recursive helps avoid a StackOverflowError =
there, you still get a StackOverflowError when you send the task to a =
worker node because Java serialization uses recursion. The only real fix =
therefore with the current codebase is to increase your JVM stack size. =
Longer-term, I=92d like us to automatically call checkpoint() to break =
lineage graphs when they exceed a certain size, which would avoid the =
problems in both DAGScheduler and Java serialization. We could also =
manually add this to ALS now without having a solution for other =
programs. That would be a great change to make to fix this JIRA.

Agree that it should be fixed if possible. But why run ALS for 50 =
iterations=3F It tends to pretty much converge (to within 0.001 or so RMSE)=
 after 5-10 and even 20 is probably overkill.=E2=80=94

I think "it depends" a fair bit here.

That's a good default absolute convergence cutoff, although it's not crazy
to want to run to further convergence since +/- 0.001 can make a difference
in top-N recommendations that is noticeable, and it can seem weird that
it's 'converged' while answers are non-trivially changing.

And this depends on how fast it converges, and that can be influenced by
the scale of the data (vs rank) and lambda.

50 is generally a lot although it's not going to get the same error as 5 x
10-iteration runs. I am sure it will be necessary for Spark to succeed on
50 iterations of something, which is not news.

I was hoping to propose for ALS was a convergence criterion, since indeed I
think most cases will converge much faster. Then the iterations param can
be "max iterations" instead, and at least it's harder to make the thing try
to do 50+ iterations.

(We are also looking to rebuild some other related functions on top, like
running N models at once -- for the cost of more computation should get you
to a better solution in fewer iterations over all the models. Sort of
helps.)


So far this message has not been relevant to the original issue. $0.02:
This problem is, I think, one that is more likely to come up at scale.
Those are environments where people are probably running on a cluster,
which has HDFS. If the checkpoint answer needs HDFS, it may be just fine to
solve the problem with checkpointing only where checkpointing is available.

Hi,

Below is the implementation for GroupByKey. (v, 0.8.0)


def groupByKey(partitioner: Partitioner): RDD[(K, Seq[V])] = {
    def createCombiner(v: V) = ArrayBuffer(v)
    def mergeValue(buf: ArrayBuffer[V], v: V) = buf += v
    val bufs = combineByKey[ArrayBuffer[V]](
      createCombiner _, mergeValue _, null, partitioner,
mapSideCombine=false)
    bufs.asInstanceOf[RDD[(K, Seq[V])]]
  }

and CombineValuesByKey (Aggregator.scala):

def combineValuesByKey(iter: Iterator[_ <: Product2[K, V]]) : Iterator[(K,
C)] = {
    val combiners = new JHashMap[K, C]
    for (kv <- iter) {
      val oldC = combiners.get(kv._1)
      if (oldC == null) {
        combiners.put(kv._1, createCombiner(kv._2))
      } else {
        combiners.put(kv._1, mergeValue(oldC, kv._2))
      }
    }
    combiners.iterator
  }

My doubt is why null is being passed for mergeCombiners closure.

If two different partitions have same key, wouldn't there be the
requirement to merge them afterwards?

Thanks,
Archit.

groupByKey does merge the values associated with the same key in different
partitions:

scala> val rdd = sc.parallelize(List(1, 1, 1, 1),
4).mapPartitionsWithIndex((idx, itr) => List(("foo", idx ->
math.random),("bar", idx -> math.random)).toIterator)

(foo,(0,0.7387266457142971))

Hi guys,

Discussion has proceeded positively, so I'm calling for a community VOTE =
for the graduation of Apache Spark (incubating) into a top level =
project. If this VOTE is successful, then I'll call an Incubator PMC =
VOTE in 72 hours, and if that is successful, we=92ll submit the project =
graduation resolution below into the board agenda for the next Apache =
board meeting.

So far, I've heard the following VOTEs (implied) during the DISCUSS =
thread. If you see your name there is no need to VOTE again and I=92ll =
carry through the VOTE as below. If you want to change your VOTE, or I =
got it wrong, let me know and we'll change it.

+1

Matei Zaharia
Reynold Xin
Tathagata Das

Patrick Wendell
Mark Hamstra
Chris Mattmann *
Tom Graves
Henry Saputra *
Andy Konwinski
Josh Rosen
Mosharaf Chowdhury
Mridul Muralidharan
Nick Pentreath
Andrew Xia
Haoyuan Li

* - indicates IPMC

Anyone else interested, please VOTE to graduate Apache Spark from the =
Incubator. I'll try and close the VOTE on Wednesday and then start the =
Incubator PMC VOTE on general@incubator.apache.org.

[ ] +1 Graduate Apache Spark (incubating) from the Incubator per the =
resolution below.
[ ] +0 Don't care.
[ ] -1 Don't graduate Apache Spark (incubating) from the Incubator =
because..

Thanks guys! The resolution is included below.

That was run on 0.8.0-incubating ...which raises a question that has been
recurring to me of late: Why are people continuing to use 0.8.0 months
after 0.8.1 has been out and when 0.9.0 is in release candidates?  It
doesn't make a relevant difference in this case, but in general, chasing
bugs in code that is two generations out-of-date doesn't make for very
efficient development.  Spark is still pre-1.0 and is rapidly-developing
software.  As such, you should expect that the pain of staying up-to-date
is less than the pain of falling months behind -- but there is no avoiding
pain in pre-1.0 software.  Once we reach more stability and more rigorous
versioning/release practices with 1.0, it will make more sense to stick
with a major.minor release for a while and only pick up the
major.minor.patchlevel increments, but we're not there yet.

While I echo Mark's sentiment, versioning has nothing to do with this
problem. It has been the case even in Spark 0.8.0.

Note that mapSideCombine is turned off for groupByKey, so there is no need
to merge any combiners.

Hi Matei,

One thing I noticed that you did was to drop the mentors and Champion
off of the PMC constituency. While I don't personally take any offense
to that, I think you will want to keep at least a few of your mentors
around that are ASF members. This has the dual benefit of:

1. Making sure that Apache Spark has a shot at getting members elected
at the next members meeting (which would be tough unless you had some
mentors who knew what was going on in the project -- not impossible but
tough)

2. Helping and hanging around with any Apache way stuff

Up to you but I thought I'd raise the point.

Cheers,
Chris

Hey Chris, this is a good point =97 I didn=92t realize that the mentors =
would have other roles later in interacting with the ASF, I thought they =
were just focused on the incubation process. In that case I think I=92d =
propose we add you, for example, once the project is up. For simplicity =
I don=92t think it makes sense to cancel the current vote and add =
another person, but we can have a new vote once we have a PMC. Help in =
this area is definitely appreciated.

If I build Spark for Hadoop 1.0.4 (either "SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=1.0.4
sbt/sbt assembly"  or "sbt/sbt assembly") or use the binary distribution,
'sbt/sbt test' runs successfully.

However, if I build Spark targeting any other Hadoop versions (e.g.
"SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=1.2.1 sbt/sbt assembly", "SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=2.2.0
sbt/sbt assembly"), I'm getting the following errors with 'sbt/sbt test':

1) type mismatch errors with JavaPairDStream.scala
2) following test failures
[error] Failed tests:
[error] org.apache.spark.ShuffleNettySuite
[error] org.apache.spark.ShuffleSuite
[error] org.apache.spark.FileServerSuite
[error] org.apache.spark.DistributedSuite

I don't have Hadoop 1.0.4 installed on my test systems (but the test
succeeds, and failed with the installed Hadoop versions). I'm seeing these
sbt test errors with the previous 0.9.0 RCs and 0.8.1, too.

I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this problem or I'm missing something
to run the test correctly.

Thanks,
Taka

It is possible that you have generated the assembly jar using one version
of Hadoop, and then another assembly jar with another version. Those tests
that failed are all using a local cluster that sets up multiple processes,
which would require launching Spark worker processes using the assembly
jar. If that's indeed the problem, removing the extra assembly jars should
fix them.

Hey Taka,

If you build a second version you need to clean the existing assembly jar.

The reference implementation of the tests are the ones on the U.C.
Berkeley Jenkins. These are passing for Branch 0.9 for both Hadoop 1
and Hadoop 2 versions, so I'm inclined to think it's an issue with
your test env or setup.

I'm always running sbt clean before building Spark. And I'm seeing the
errors when I build Spark first time after downloading and extracting
spark-0.9.0-incubating.tgz<http://people.apache.org/~pwendell/spark-0.9.0-incubating-rc5/spark-0.9.0-incubating.tgz>

Just in case, I deleted the test.jar files (in work/app-201401XXXXXX-0000
directories) which didn't get deleted by sbt clean. But I still see the
errors.

This is not a blocker for the release at all. I've tested the RC5 and don't
find any other issue right now.

I'm curious if anyone else sees this.

Subject: Problems while moving from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1

Hi,

Implementation of aggregation logic has been changed with 0.8.1
(Aggregator.scala)

It is now using AppendOnlyMap as compared to java.util.HashMap in 0.8.0
release.

Aggregator.scala
def combineValuesByKey(iter: Iterator[_ <: Product2[K, V]]) : Iterator[(K,
C)] = {
    val combiners = new AppendOnlyMap[K, C]
    var kv: Product2[K, V] = null
    val update = (hadValue: Boolean, oldValue: C) => {
      if (hadValue) mergeValue(oldValue, kv._2) else createCombiner(kv._2)
    }
    while (iter.hasNext) {
      kv = iter.next()
      combiners.changeValue(kv._1, update)
    }
    combiners.iterator
  }

I am facing problem that in changeValue function of AppendOnlyMap, it
computes,
val curKey = data(2 * pos)
which is coming as null and eventually giving NPE.

AppendOnlyMap.scala
def changeValue(key: K, updateFunc: (Boolean, V) => V): V = {
    val k = key.asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
    if (k.eq(null)) {
      if (!haveNullValue) {
        incrementSize()
      }
      nullValue = updateFunc(haveNullValue, nullValue)
      haveNullValue = true
      return nullValue
    }
    var pos = rehash(k.hashCode) & mask
    var i = 1
    while (true) {
      val curKey = data(2 * pos)
      if (k.eq(curKey) || k.equals(curKey)) {
        val newValue = updateFunc(true, data(2 * pos + 1).asInstanceOf[V])
        data(2 * pos + 1) = newValue.asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
        return newValue
      } else if (curKey.eq(null)) {
        val newValue = updateFunc(false, null.asInstanceOf[V])
        data(2 * pos) = k
        data(2 * pos + 1) = newValue.asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
        incrementSize()
        return newValue
      } else {
        val delta = i
        pos = (pos + delta) & mask
        i += 1
      }
    }
    null.asInstanceOf[V] // Never reached but needed to keep compiler happy
  }


Other info:
1. My code works fine with 0.8.0.
2. I used groupByKey transformation.
3. I replaces the Aggregator.scala with the older version(0.8.0), compiled
it, Restarted Master and Worker, It ran successfully.

Thanks and Regards,
Archit Thakur.

Is Spark active in submitting anything for this?

Folks,

5 days from the end of the CFP, we have only 50 talks submitted. We need
three times that just to fill the space, and preferably a lot more so that
we have some variety to choose from to put together a schedule.

I know that we usually have over half the content submitted in the last 48
hours, so I'm not panicking yet, but it's worrying. More worrying, however
is that 2/3 of those submissions are from the Usual Suspects (ie, httpd and
Tomcat), and YOUR project isn't represented.

We would love to have a whole day of Lucene, and of OpenOffice, and of
Cordova, and of Felix and Celix and Helix and Nelix. Or a half day.

We need your talk submissions. We need you to come tell the world why your
project matters, why you spend your time working on it, and what exciting
new thing you hacked into it during the snow storms. (Or heat wave, as the
case may be.)

Please help us get the word out to your developer and user communities that
we're looking for quality talks about their favorite Apache project, about
related technologies, about ways that it's being used, and plans for its
future. Help us make this ApacheCon amazing.

We have a couple of customer stories around Spark would that be something
that would be interesting here?
Also what is the process of submitting talks?

To: user@spark.incubator.apache.org


Hello, community,

I have three questions about spark streaming.

1,
I noticed that one streaming example (StatefulNetworkWordCount) has one
interesting phenomenon:
since this workload only prints the first 10 rows of the final RDD, this
means if the data influx rate is fast enough (much faster than hand typing
in keyboard), then the final RDD would have more than one partition, assume
it's 2 partitions, but the second partition won't be computed at all
because the first partition suffice to serve the first 10 rows. However,
these two workloads must make checkpoint to that RDD. This would lead to a
very time consuming checkpoint process because the checkpoint to the second
partition can only start before it is computed. So, is this workload only
designed for demonstration purpose, for example, only designed for one
partition RDD?

(I have attached a figure to illustrate what I've said, please tell me if
mailing list doesn't welcome attachment.
A short description about the experiment
Hardware specs: 4 cores
Software specs: spark local cluster, 5 executors (workers), each one has
one core, each executor has 1G memory
Data influx speed: 3MB/s
Data source: one ServerSocket in local file
Streaming App's name: StatefulNetworkWordCount
Job generation frequency: one job per second
Checkpoint time: once per 10s
JobManager.numThreads = 2)



(And another workload might have the same problem:
PageViewStream's slidingPageCounts)

2,
Does anybody have a Top-K wordcount streaming source code?

3,
Can anybody share your real world streaming example? for example, including
source code, and cluster configuration details?

thanks,
dachuan.

I can help you setup streaming with algebird for Uniques.. I suppose you
can extend that to top K using algebird functions.
First why dont you setup spark streaming on your machine using this guide:
http://docs.sigmoidanalytics.com/index.php/Running_A_Simple_Streaming_Job_in_Local_Machine
Then lemme rummage around for my algebird codebase.

Now add these jars to the lib folder of the streaming project as well as in
the sparkstreamingcontext object jar list:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/00sy9mv8qsefwc1/vsEXF0aHsJ
These are algebird jars.

This also contains the algebird scala for streaming uniques:

Hey Heiko,

Spark 0.9 introduced a common config class for Spark applications. It
also (initially) supported loading config files in the nested typesafe
format, but this was removed last minute due to a bug. In 1.0 we'll
probably add support for config files, though it may not support
typesafe's tree-style config files because that conflicts with the
naming style of several spark options (we have options where x.y and
x.y.z are both named keys, and the typesafe parser doesn't allow
that).

Looks like your MyCustomKeyType.equals() method doesn't correctly handle a
null argument. In general, the contract of equals is to return false if
called with a null argument, which this code currently relies on.

This could still be patched for the sake of backwards compatibility with
similarly incomplete equals() methods which previously worked.

Ok. But what if it is tried to call with null object rather than passing
null.
Code would be internally doing a.equals(b) somewhere where b was null. What
if a happens to be null. Wont it give NPE there itself. Or Does it have a
null check there. I mean why would null be created for MyCustomKeyType,
when it should have some data.
How could MyCustomKeyType be null when I never filled null anywhere.

Agreed.

The code would not call null.equals(b); only a.equals(null) is allowable
(we check for k.eq(null) at the top).

a.equals(null) returning false is part of the Object.equals()
contract<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)>,
so it is not invalid to use it, it just may be unintuitive if you expect
never to have null references of MyCustomKeyType hanging around.

Hi Patrick,

That sounds great, I just fired a JIRA ticket for this
(https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-1048). We are setting up
spark in one of our data center (~100 machines) and would like to have this
feature ASAP. Please let me know if there are things we can help.

Thanks
-Shengzhe

That certainly sounds good. I=92m not sure if people at Berkeley or =
Databricks will go there, but it may make sense. (Basically just not =
sure how much the audience there is interested in big data.. but perhaps =
just the ability to hack parallel stuff in Python and Scala will be =
interesting.)

Hi Matei,

There have been several tracks on Big Data technologies at the past
few ApacheCons and they're definitely worth attending.

Cheers,
Chris

Thanks for the feedback, Chris. I will submit the proposal tomorrow.

Time is the priceless commodity for all of us, but I think Spark/Shark have
great potentials to be the next generation platform for _all_ parallel and
highly scalable analytics. hence, I am totally ok with spending energy to h=
elp
to advance the platform as much as I can. And it is not a tongue-in-a-cheek
statement :)

I see this error thrown from Executor.scala:

task = ser.deserialize[Task[Any]](taskBytes,
Thread.currentThread.getContextClassLoader)

Any suggestions to break down the task to smaller chunk to avoid this?

Thanks,
Qiuzhuang

We experienced similar problem when implementing LDA on Spark.  Now we call
RDD.checkpoint every 10 iterations to cut the lineage DAG.  Notice that
checkpointing hurts performance since it submits a job to write HDFS.

Hi Patrick,

> The staging repository for this release can be found at:
> https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachespark-1006/

I was going to import this rc5 release into our internal Maven repo to
try it out, but noticed that the version doesn't have "rc5" in it.

This means that, if there is an rc6, I'll have to re-import over the same
artifacts, which is generally not a good thing given Maven assumes artifacts
never change.

Is this restriction required by the blessing process, or would it be
possible to sneak rc5 into the pre-final version number?

For now, I'll just build a local version, at the same commit, but with
the as 0.9.0-incubating-rc5.

Apologies if this was discussed before and I just missed it.

- Stephen

Hi Tathagata,

This code that you have sent me is it a scala code?

yourDStream.foreachRDD(rdd =3D> {

   // Get and print first n elements
   val firstN =3D rdd.take(n)
   println("First N elements =3D " + firstN)

  // Count the number of elements in each batch
  println("RDD has " + rdd.count() + " elements")

})

Thanks

Subject: Re: [VOTE] Release Apache Spark 0.9.0-incubating (rc5)

Hey Stephen,

Yes this runs afoul of good practice in Maven where a given version
shouldn't be re-used. As far as I understand though, it is required by
the way the Apache release process works.

The artifacts and repository content that get voted on need to exactly
match the final release. So we can't hold a vote on a version of the
code where everything says "-rcx", then we go back and change the
source code and do a second push to maven with code that doesn't have
an "-rcx" suffix. This would effectively change the code that is being
released.

I was thinking as a work around that maybe we could publish a second
set of staging artifacts that are versioned with -rcX for people to
test against. I think as long as we make it clear that these are not
the "official artifacts" being voted on it might be okay. I'm not
totally sure if this is allowed though.

- Patrick

Yes, it was my intention to write scala code. But I may have failed to
write a correct one that compiles. Apologies.

Also, something to keep in mind. This is the dev mailing for Spark
developers. Questions related to using Spark should be sent to
user@spark.incubator.apache.org

Okay, that makes sense. I was assuming that was the restriction.

I think that would be really helpful. For scala, the rc/milestone
releases are even pushed to Maven central, although I understand if
that's not worth doing for Spark.

Hi Tathagata, doesn't worry I am looking for a manner in the source code of
JavaNetworkWordcount print me in console the sum of the total of words in a
file, not one word by line.

Thanks

Something like maybe. From this example -
https://github.com/tdas/incubator-spark/blob/recoverable-example-fix/exampl=
es/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/streaming/examples/JavaRecoverableWordCou=
nt.java


      wordCounts.foreachRDD(new Function2<JavaPairRDD<String,
Integer>, Time, Void>() {

        @Override public Void call(JavaPairRDD<String, Integer>
pairRDD, Time time) throws Exception {

          String counts =3D "Counts at time " + time + " [" +
Joiner.on(", ").join(pairRDD.collect())  + "]";

          System.out.println(counts);

          System.out.println("Appending to " + outputFile.getAbsolutePath()=
);

          Files.append(counts + "\n", outputFile, Charset.defaultCharset())=
;

          return null;

        }
      });

Note that Joiner is a class from Google Commons library. Not integral
to what you want to do.

By the way, is there any plan to make a pluggable backend for

Cassandra backend.

Hi Guys,

I'm not very good like java programmer, so anybody could me help with this
code piece from JavaNetworkWordcount:

JavaPairDStream<String, Integer> wordCounts =3D words.map(
        new PairFunction<String, String, Integer>() {
     @Override
          public Tuple2<String, Integer> call(String s) throws Exception {
            return new Tuple2<String, Integer>(s, 1);
          }
        }).reduceByKey(new Function2<Integer, Integer, Integer>() {
          @Override
          public Integer call(Integer i1, Integer i2) throws Exception {
            return i1 + i2;
          }
        });

      JavaPairDStream<String, Integer> counts =3D
wordCounts.reduceByKeyAndWindow(
        new Function2<Integer, Integer, Integer>() {
          public Integer call(Integer i1, Integer i2) { return i1 + i2; }
        },
        new Function2<Integer, Integer, Integer>() {
          public Integer call(Integer i1, Integer i2) { return i1 - i2; }
        },
        new Duration(60 * 5 * 1000),
        new Duration(1 * 1000)
      );

I would like to think a manner of counting and after summing  and getting a
total from words counted in a single file, for example a book in txt
extension Don Quixote. The counts function give me the resulted from each
word has found and not a total of words from the file.
Tathagata has sent me a piece from scala code, Thanks Tathagata by your
attention with my posts I am very thankfully,

  yourDStream.foreachRDD(rdd =3D> {

   // Get and print first n elements
   val firstN =3D rdd.take(n)
   println("First N elements =3D " + firstN)

  // Count the number of elements in each batch
  println("RDD has " + rdd.count() + " elements")

})

yourDStream.count.print()

Could anybody help me?


Thanks Guys

I might have missed it earlier, but is anybody planning to present at
ApacheCon?  I think it's in Denver this year, April 7-9.

Thinking of submitting a talk about how we use Spark and Cassandra.

I know this is still a few months off and folks are rushing towards 0.9
release, but do the devs have a rough date for Spark Summit 2014? Looks
like it'll be in summer, but is it Jun / July / Aug / Sep ? Even
"late-summer" would help.

Summer being a popular vacation time, a few months advance notice would be
greatly appreciated (read: I missed last summit due to a pre-scheduled
vacation and would hate to miss this one :)

Thanks,
Ameet

Let me first ask for a few clarifications.

1. If you just want to count the words in a single text file like Don
Quixote (that is, not for a stream of data), you should use only Spark.
Then the program to count the frequency of words in a text file would look
like this in Java. If you are not super-comfortable with Java, then I
strongly recommend using the Scala API or pyspark. For scala, it may be a
little trickier to learn if you have absolutely no idea. But it is worth
it. The frequency count would look like this.

val sc =3D new SparkContext(...)
val linesInFile =3D sc.textFile("path_to_file")
val words =3D linesInFile.flatMap(line =3D> line.split(" "))
val frequencies =3D words.map(word =3D> (word, 1L)).reduceByKey(_ + _)
println("Word frequencies =3D " + frequences.collect())      // collect is
costly if the file is large


2. Let me assume that you want to do read a stream of text over the network
and then print the count of total number of words into a file. Note that it
is "total number of words" and not "frequency of each word". The Java
version would be something like this.

DStream<Integer> totalCounts =3D words.count();

totalCounts.foreachRDD(new Function2<JavaRDD<Long>, Time, Void>() {
   @Override public Void call(JavaRDD<Long> pairRDD, Time time) throws
Exception {
           Long totalCount =3D totalCounts.first();

           // print to screen
           System.out.println(totalCount);

          // append count to file
          ...
          return null;
    }
})

This is count how many words have been received in each batch. The Scala
version would be much simpler to read.

words.count().foreachRDD(rdd =3D> {
    val totalCount =3D rdd.first()

    // print to screen
    println(totalCount)

    // append count to file
    ...
})

Hope this helps! I apologize if the code doesnt compile, I didnt test for
syntax and stuff.

I just tried the EC2 scripts as a part of this rc5, and it *looks* like it
did not setup this version properly.  Is that in scope for this rc?

starts instances and use some scripts to setup this version. For that to

Yes, I did a couple of days ago. And I will tweak it to be more technical than
@spark-summit, cause I hope the audience will more development oriented. 

I agree that more the merrier though!
